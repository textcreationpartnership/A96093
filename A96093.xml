            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>He</hi> went up.] <hi>He,</hi> in whom there was a combination of vertues, a conſtellation of beauties; He whoſe lips were not only <hi>ſweet</hi> as the hony-comb, but did <hi>drop</hi> as the hony-comb; his words an Oracle, his works a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, his life a Pattern, his death a Sacrifice, <hi>He went up into a mountain and taught.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way enobled and qualified for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt was an <hi>intelligent</hi> Preacher. He had <hi>the Spirit without meaſure,</hi> John 3.34. and knew how to ſpeak a word <hi>in due ſeaſon,</hi> when to humble, when to comfort. We cannot know all the faces of our hearers, Chriſt knew the <hi>hearts</hi> of his hearers, He underſtood what Doctrine would beſt ſuit with them; as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman can tell what ſort of graine is proper for ſuch a ſoyle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was a <hi>powerful</hi> Preacher, <hi>He ſpake with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> Matth. 7.29. He could ſet mens ſinnes before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168897:8"/>
them, and ſhow them their very hearts, <hi>John</hi> 4.29. <hi>Come ſee a man which told me all things which ever I did.</hi> That is the beſt Glaſſe not which is moſt richly ſet with Pearle, but which ſhows the trueſt face; Chriſt was a Preacher to the conſcience, He breathed as much <hi>zeal</hi> as <hi>eloquence;</hi> he often touched upon the heart-ſtrings. What is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> is more truly applicable to Chriſt, He ſpake <hi>as if he had been within a man.</hi> He could drive the wedge of his Doctrine in the moſt knotty piece; He was able with his two-edged ſword to pierce an heart of ſtone. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> John 7.46.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt was a <hi>ſucceſſeful</hi> Preacher; He had the Art of converting ſouls. <hi>John</hi> 10.40. <hi>Many beleeved on him;</hi> yea, perſons of rank and quality, <hi>John</hi> 12.42. <hi>Among the chief Rulers many beleeved.</hi> He who had <hi>Grace poured into his lips,</hi> Pſalm 45.2. could pour grace into his hearers hearts; He had the <hi>Key of David</hi> in his hand, and when he pleaſed did open the hearts of men, and make way both for himſelf and his Doctrine to enter. If he did blow the Trumpet his very enemies would come under his Banner, upon his Summons none durſt but ſurrender.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt was a <hi>lawful</hi> Preacher; as He had his <hi>Unction</hi> from his Father, ſo his <hi>Miſsion,</hi> John 8.18. <hi>The Father that ſent me</hi> bears witneſſe of me. Chriſt (in whom were all perfections concentred, yet,) would be ſolemnly ſealed, and inaugurated into his Miniſterial as wel as Mediatory Office; if Jeſus Chriſt would not enter upon the work of the Miniſtry without a Commiſſion, how abſurdly impudent are they who without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant dare invade this holy Fuction! There muſt be a lawful admiſſion of men into the Miniſtry<note n="*" place="margin">Nemo in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia debet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice concionari niſi rite voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> Our Lord Chriſt as he gave <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> which were extraordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſo <hi>Paſtors and Teachers</hi> which were initiated and made in an ordinary way, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and He will have a Miniſtry perpetuated, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</hi> Sure, there is as much need of Ordination <hi>now,</hi> as in Chriſts time, and the time of the Apoſtles, there being <hi>then</hi> extraordinary gifts in the Church which are now ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But why ſhould not the Miniſtry lye in common? <hi>Hath the Lord ſpoken only by Moſes?</hi> Num. 12.2. Why ſhould not one preach as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God (who is the God of order) hath made the work of the Miniſtry a ſelect diſtinct Office from any other. As in the body natural the members have a diſtinct office, the eye is to ſee, the hand to work; you may as well ſay, why ſhould not the hand ſee as well as the eye? becauſe God hath made the diſtinction, He hath put the viſive faculty into the one, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So here, God hath made a diſtinction between the work of the Miniſtry and other work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Where is this diſtinction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We finde in Scripture a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Paſtor and People, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>The Elders</hi> (or Miniſters) <hi>I exhort, Feed the flock of God which is among you.</hi> If any one may preach, by the ſame rule all may, and then what will become of the Apoſtles diſtinction? Where will the flock of God be if all be Paſtors?</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath cut out the Miniſter his work which is proper for him, and doth not belong to any other. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, give thy ſelf wholly to them;</hi> or as it is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>be thou wholly in them.</hi> This charge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168897:9"/>
is peculiar to the Miniſter, and doth not concern any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is not ſpoken to the Tradeſman that he ſhould give himſelf wholly to Doctrine and Exhortation, no, let him look to his ſhop; it is not ſpoken to the plough-man that he ſhould give himſelf wholly to preaching, no, let him give himſelf to his plough. It is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters charge; the Apoſtle ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him, to the reſt who had the hands of the Presbytery laid on them; and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>rightly dividing the word of truth.</hi> This is ſpoken peculiarly to the Miniſter. Every one that can <hi>read</hi> the Word aright, cannot <hi>divide</hi> the Word aright. So that the work of the Miniſtry doth not lye in common, it is a ſelect, peculiar work. As none might touch the <hi>Arke</hi> but the Prieſts; none may touch this Temple-office but ſuch as are called to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But if a man hath gifts, is not this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? I anſwer, no; as <hi>grace</hi> is not ſufficient to make a Miniſter, ſo neither <hi>gifts.</hi> The Scripture puts a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between gifting and ſending, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach unleſſe they be ſent?</hi> If gifts were enough to conſtitute a Miniſter, the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, How ſhall they preach unleſſe they be <hi>gifted?</hi> but he ſaith Unleſſe they be <hi>ſent;</hi> As in other callings gifts do not make a Magiſtrate; The Attorney that pleads at Bar may have as good gifts as the Judge that ſits upon the Bench, but he muſt have a Commiſſion before he ſit as Judge. If it be thus in matters Civil, much more Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Sacred; which are as <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaith, <hi>Maximi mementi,</hi> things of the higheſt importance. Thoſe therefore that do uſurp the Miniſterial work without any ſpecial deſignation and appointment, do diſcover more <hi>pride</hi> than <hi>zeale.</hi> They act out of their ſphere;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168897:10"/>
and are guilty of Thievery; they ſteal upon a people: And as they come without a <hi>Call,</hi> ſo they ſtay without a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Jer. 23.32. <hi>I ſent them not,</hi>

                  <hi>therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt, the Preacher.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168897:10"/>
have Gods Champions been in former Ages, in fulfilling the work of their Miniſtry; as we read of <hi>Chryſoſtom, Auſtin, Baſil</hi> the great, <hi>Calvin, Bucer,</hi> and others, who for the work of Chriſt <hi>were nigh unto death.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Miniſters of Chriſt (according to his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern) ſhould be ambitiouſly deſirous of all opportunities for ſoul-ſervice, are</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <hi>Commiſſion:</hi> God hath intruſted them as Ambaſſadors: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Now you know an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador waits for a day of Audience, and as ſoon as a day is granted, he doth faithfully and impartially deliver the mind of his Prince: Thus Chriſts Miniſters having a Commiſſion delegated to them to negotiate for ſouls, ſhould be glad when there is a day of Audience, that they may impart the mind and will of Chriſt to his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Titles.</hi> 1. Miniſters are called Gods <hi>Seeds-men,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.11. therefore they muſt upon all occaſions be ſcattering the bleſſed ſeed of the Word: <hi>The Sower muſt go forth and ſowe;</hi> yea, though the ſeed fall upon ſtones (as uſually it doth) yet we muſt diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſcatter the ſeed of the Word upon ſtony hearts, becauſe <hi>even of theſe ſtones God is able to raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to himſelf. 2. Miniſters are called <hi>Stars;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt ſhine by Word and Doctrine in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. Thus our Lord Chriſt hath ſet them a pattern in the Text: <hi>Seeing the multitude, he went up into the Mountain;</hi> here was a light ſet upon an hill; the bright Morning Star ſhining to all that were round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Chriſt calls his Miniſters, <hi>Lux Mundi, the light of the World,</hi> Matth. 5.14. therefore they muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways giving forth their luſtre; their light muſt not go out till it be in the ſocket, or till violent death as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſher put it out.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168897:11"/>3. Chriſts Miniſters muſt <hi>anſam arripere,</hi> catch at all occaſions of doing good to others, in regard of the <hi>work</hi> which they are about, and that is ſaving of ſouls; what a precious thing is a ſoul<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>. Macar.</note>? Chriſt takes as it were a pair of ſcales in his hands, and he puts the world in one ſcale, and the ſoul in the other, and the ſoul out-weighs: <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. The ſoul is of a noble original, of a quick operation; 'tis a flower of eternity; <hi>here</hi> in the bud; <hi>in heaven,</hi> fully ripe and blown. The ſoul is one of the richeſt pieces of Embroidery that ever God made; the underſtanding beſpangled with light; the will inveſted with liberty; the affections like Muſical Inſtruments tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the finger of the Holy Ghoſt. The ſoul is Chriſts Partner, the Angels Familiar; now if the ſouls of men are of ſo noble an extract, and made capable of glory, oh how zealouſly induſtrious ſhould Chriſts Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters be to ſave theſe ſouls! if Chriſt did ſpend his blood for ſouls, well may we ſpend our ſweat: It was <hi>Austins</hi> prayer that Chriſt might find him at his coming, <hi>aut Precantem, aut Praedicantem;</hi> either Praying, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: What a ſad ſight is it to ſee precious ſouls as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pearls and Diamonds caſt into the dead Sea of Hell?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miniſters of Chriſt <hi>ſeeing the multitude,</hi> muſt <hi>aſcend the Mount,</hi> becauſe there are ſo many <hi>Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> of Satan who lie at the catch to ſubvert ſouls: How doth the Old Serpent caſt out of his mouth floods of water after <hi>the woman to drown her?</hi> Revel. 12.15. What floods of Hereſie have been poured out in City and Country, which have over-flown the banks, not only of <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Civility. Ignatius</hi> calls Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>the invention of the Divel;</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> calls it, <hi>dulce venenum,</hi> a ſweet poyſon: Mens ears like Spunges have ſucked in this poyſon: Never were the Divels
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168897:11"/>
Commodities more vendible in <hi>England</hi> than now; a fine tongue can put off bad wares; the Jeſuit can ſilver over his lyes, and dreſs error in truths Coat; a weak brain is ſoon intoxicated; when flattery and ſubtilty meet with the ſimple, they eaſily become a prey: The Romiſh Whore enticeth many to drink down the poyſon of her Idolatry and filthineſs, becauſe it is given <hi>in a golden Cup,</hi> Revel. 17.4. If all who have <hi>the plague of the head</hi> ſhould dye, it would much increaſe the Bill of Mortality; Now if there be ſo many Emiſſaries of Satan abroad, who labour to make Proſelytes to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how doth it concern them whom God hath put into the work of the Miniſtry, to beſtir themſelves, and lay hold on all opportunities, that by their ſpiritual antidotes they may <hi>convert ſinners from the error of their way and ſave their ſouls from death!</hi> Jam. 5. ult. Miniſters muſt not only be <hi>Paſtores,</hi> but <hi>Praeliatores;</hi> in one hand they muſt hold the bread of life, and <hi>feed the Flock of God;</hi> in the other hand, they muſt hold the Sword of the Spirit, and fight againſt thoſe errors which carry damnation in their front.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould wait for all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſoul-ſervice, becauſe the Preaching of the Word hath ſo many <hi>Remora's</hi> that hinder the progreſs and ſucceſs of it; never did <hi>Pilot</hi> meet with ſo many <hi>Euroclydons</hi> and croſs winds in a Voyage, as the ſpiritual <hi>Pilots</hi> of Gods Church do when they are tranſporting ſouls to heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some hearers have <hi>bad memories,</hi> Jam. 1.25. Their memories are like leaking Veſſels; all the precious wine of holy Doctrine that is poured in, runs out preſently: Miniſters cannot by ſtudy find a truth ſo faſt as others can loſe it; if the meat doth not ſtay in the ſtomack, it can never breed good blood; if a truth delivered doth not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168897:12"/>
ſtay in the memory, we can never be as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Nouriſhed up in the words of faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.6. How often doth the Divel, that <hi>Fowle of the Aire,</hi> pick up the good ſeed that is ſown<note n="*" place="margin">Verbum Dei, ſuffurante Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolo memoriâ excidit.</note>! If Thieves ſteal away peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples money, they tell every one, and make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint they have been Robbed; but there is a worſe Thief they are not aware of! How many Sermons hath the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtollen from them! how many truths have they been robbed of, which might have been ſo many death-bed cordials! now if the Word preached ſlides ſo faſt out of the memory, Miniſters had need the oftner go up the preaching Mount, that at laſt ſome truth may abide, and be as <hi>a nail faſtened by the Maſters of Aſsemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168897:17"/>
were but a painted felicity, a glorious miſery. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>And behold all was vanity.</hi> Bleſſedneſs is too noble and delicate a Plant to dwell in Natures ſoile.</p>
                  <p>That bleſſedneſs doth not lie in Externals, I ſhall prove by theſe five Demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe things which are not commenſurate to the deſires of the ſoul, can never make a man bleſſed; but tranſitory things are not commenſurate to the deſires of the ſoul; therefore they cannot render him bleſſed; nothing on earth can ſatisfie. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that loveth ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver;</hi> Riches are unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are not real; the world is called a <hi>faſhion,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Figure, ſometimes a ſhew or apparition. Riches are but tin'd over<note n="*" place="margin">Bracteata faelicitas, <hi>Sen.</hi>
                     </note>; they are like Alchymy, which gliſters a little in our eyes, but at death all this Alchymy will be worn off. Riches are but ſugred lyes, pleaſant impoſtures; like a gilded Cover, which hath not one leaf of true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort bound up in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are not ſutable: The ſoul is a ſpiritual thing, riches are of an earthly extract<note n="*" place="margin">Effodiuntur opes.</note>, and how can theſe fill a ſpiritual ſubſtance? a man may as well fill his Cheſt with grace, as his heart with gold; if a man were crowned with all the delights of the world, nay, if God ſhould build him an houſe among the Stars, yet the reſtleſs eye of his unſatisfied mind would be looking ſtill higher, he would be prying beyond the heavens for ſome hidden rarities which he thinks he hath not yet attained to; ſo unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the thirſt of the ſoul, till it come to bath in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of life, and to center upon true bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which cannot quiet the heart in a ſtorme, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intitle a man to bleſſedneſs; but earthly things accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated, cannot rock the troubled heart quiet, therefore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168897:17"/>
they cannot make one bleſſed. If the Spirit be wounded, can the creature poure in wine and oyle into theſe wounds? if God ſets on conſcience, and it flies in a mans face, can worldly comforts take off this angry fury? Is there any Harp to drive away the <hi>evil Spirit?</hi> outward things can no more cure the agony of conſcience, than a ſilken ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can cure a gouty leg. When <hi>Saul</hi> was ſore diſtreſſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. could all the Jewels of his Crown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him? if God be angry, whoſe <hi>fury is poured out like fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by him,</hi> Nahum 1.6. can a wedge of gold be a Screen to keep off this fire? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19. <hi>They ſhall caſt their ſilver in the ſtreets; their ſilver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord.</hi> King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was Carouſing and Ranting it; <hi>he drank wine in the golden Veſſels of the Temple,</hi> Dan. 5.3. but when the fingers of a mans hand appeared, <hi>his countenance was changed,</hi> ver. 6. his wine grew ſowre, his feaſt was ſpoiled with that Diſh which was ſerved in upon the Wall. The things of the world will no more keep out trouble of ſpirit, than a paper ſconce will keep out a bullet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which is but for a ſeaſon, cannot make one bleſſed; but all things under the Sun are but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> therefore they cannot enrich with bleſſedneſs: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary delights are like thoſe meats which we ſay are a while <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> and then preſently grow ſtale, and are out of requeſt: <hi>The world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 John 2.17. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights are winged; they may be compared to a flock of Birds in the Garden, that ſtay a little while, but when you come near to them, they take their flight and are gone. So <hi>Riches make themſelves wings, they flie away as an Eagle towards heaven,</hi> Prov. 23.5. They are like a Meteor that blazeth, but ſpends and annihilates; they are like a Caſtle made of ſnow, lying under the torrid
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168897:18"/>
beams of the Sun: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Si quid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiſſet proſperum, &amp;c.</hi> When any preferment ſmiled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was afraid to accept of it, leſt it ſhould on a ſudden give him the ſlip. Outward comforts are as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, like Tennis-balls, which are bandied up and down from one to another<note n="*" place="margin">Dei ludibria, quae ſurſum ac deorſam ſuo coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo feruntur. <hi>Plat.</hi>
                     </note>; had we the longeſt leaſe of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts, it would ſoon be run out: Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are ſtill <hi>in fugâ,</hi> they paſs away like a ſwift ſtream, or like a Ship that is going full fail. While they are with us, they are going away from us; they are like a poſie of flowers, which withers while you are ſmelling to it; like Ice, which melts away while it is in your hand. The world (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) cries out, <hi>I will leave you,</hi> and be gone<note n="*" place="margin">Caro clamat, ego inficiam; mandus clamat, ego decipiam. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note>; it takes its ſalute and farewel together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe things which do more vex than comfort, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a man bleſſed; but ſuch are all things under the Sun, therefore they cannot have bleſſedneſs affixed to them: As riches are compared to <hi>wind,</hi> Hoſea 12.1. to ſhew their <hi>vanity;</hi> ſo to <hi>thorns,</hi> Matth. 13.17. to ſhew their <hi>vexation:</hi> Thorns are not more apt to tear our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than Riches are to tear our hearts; they are thorns in the gathering, they prick with care; and as they pierce the head with care of getting, ſo they wound the heart with fear of loſing; God will have our ſweeteſt wine run dregs, yea, and taſte of a muſty Cask too, that we may not think this is the wine of Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe things which (if we have nothing elſe) will make us curſed, cannot make us bleſſed; but the ſole enjoyment of worldly things will make us curſed; therefore it is far from making us beſſed: <hi>Riches are kept for the hurt of the owner,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.13. Riches to the wicked, are fuel for <hi>pride:</hi> Ezek. 28.5. <hi>Thy heart is lifted up becauſe of thy riches;</hi> and fuel for <hi>luſt:</hi> Jer. 5.7. <hi>When I had fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery.</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:168897:18"/>
Riches are a ſnare: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in perdition.</hi> How many have pull'd down their ſouls to build up an eſtate! a ſhip may be ſo loaden with gold that it ſinks; many a mans gold hath ſunk him to hell. The rich ſinner ſeals up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his bag, and God ſeals up a curſe with it. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Woe to him that ladeth himſelf with thick clay. Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Judas</hi> for money ſold his ſalvation, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> bought their damnation; ſo that happineſs is not to be fetch'd out of the earth; they who go to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for bleſſedneſs, go to the wrong box.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> not place our bleſſedneſs here; this is to ſeek the living among the dead; as the Angel told <hi>Mary</hi> concerning Chriſt, <hi>He is not here, he is riſen,</hi> Mat. 28.6. So I may ſay of bleſſedneſs, it is not here, it is riſen, it is in an higher Region: How do men thirſt after the World, as if the pearl of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs did hang upon an earthly Crown? O ſaith one, if I had but ſuch an Eſtate, then I ſhould be happy! had I but ſuch a comfort, then I ſhould ſit down ſatisfied? Well, God gives him that comfort, and lets him ſuck out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juyce and ſpirits of it; but alas, it falls ſhort of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, it cannot fill the <hi>hiatus,</hi> and longing of his ſoul, which ſtill cries <hi>Give, give,</hi> Prov. 30.15. Juſt like a ſick man, if ſaith he, I had but ſuch a meat, I could eat it; and when he hath it, his ſtomack is bad, and he can hardly endure to taſte it; God hath put not only an <hi>empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but <hi>bitterneſs</hi> into the creature, and it is good for us that there is no perfection here, that we may raiſe our

thoughts higher, to more noble and generous delights.

                  <p>HAving ſhewn wherein bleſſedneſs doth not conſiſt, I ſhall next ſhew wherein it doth conſiſt. Bleſſedneſs doth ſtand in the fruition of the chief good. 1. It conſiſts in fruition; there muſt not be only <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> but <hi>fruition.</hi> A man may poſſeſs an Eſtate, yet not enjoy it; he may have the <hi>dominion</hi> of it, but not the <hi>comfort;</hi> as when he is in a Lethargy, or under the predominancy of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but in true bleſſedneſs there muſt be a ſenſible enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which the ſoul doth poſſeſs. 2. Bleſſedneſs lies in the fruition of <hi>the chief good;</hi> it is not every good makes a man bleſſed, but it muſt be the <hi>ſupream</hi> good, and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168897:19"/>
is God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> God is <hi>quies animae,</hi> here the ſoul doth reſt: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. Now that only in which the ſoul doth acquieſce and reſt, can make it bleſſed. The Globe or Circle, as is obſerved in Mathematicks, is of all others the moſt perfect figure, becauſe the laſt point of the figure ends in that firſt point where it began: So when the ſoul meets in God, whence it ſprang as its firſt original, then it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly bleſſed. That which makes a man bleſſed, muſt have ſix Qualifications or Ingredients in it, and theſe are found no where, but in God the chief good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In true bleſſedneſs there muſt be <hi>Meliority;</hi> that which fills with bleſſedneſs, muſt be ſuch a good as is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a mans ſelf. If you would ennoble a piece of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it muſt be by putting ſomething to it which is better than ſilver, as by putting gold or pearle to it: So that which doth ennoble the ſoul, and enrich it with bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt be by adding ſomething to it which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the ſoul, and that is God; the World is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſoul; it is but the ſouls foot-ſtool; therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not crown it with happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Ingredient is <hi>Delectability;</hi> that which brings bleſſedneſs, muſt have a delicious taſte in it, ſuch as the ſoul is infinitely raviſhed with; there muſt be in it ſpirits of delight, and quinteſſence of joy; and where can the ſoul ſuck thoſe pure comforts which do amaze it with wonder, and crown it with delight, but in God? <hi>In Deo quadam dulcedine delectatur anima, immò rapitur</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ang.</note>: The love of God is an honey-comb, which drops ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſweetneſs, and ſatisfaction into the ſoul, as is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. A kiſs from Gods mouth puts the ſoul into a Divine Extaſie, ſo that now it cries out, <hi>It is good to be here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Ingredient into bleſſedneſs, is <hi>Plenty;</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:168897:20"/>
that which makes a man bleſſed, muſt not be too ſcanty; it is a full draught which quencheth the ſouls thirſt; and where ſhall we find <hi>Plenty</hi> but <hi>in Deity?</hi> Pſal. 36.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt make him drink of the River of thy pleaſures,</hi> not <hi>Drops</hi> but <hi>Rivers.</hi> The ſoul baths it ſelf, and is laid as it were a ſteeping in the water of life; the River of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe over-flows, and empties its ſilver ſtreams into the ſouls of the bleſſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In true bleſſedneſs there muſt be <hi>Variety:</hi> Plenty without variety is apt to nauſeate; in God there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>all</hi> fulneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. What can the ſoul want, but it may be had in the chief good? God is <hi>bonum in quo omnia bona;</hi> he is a Sun, a Shield, a Portion, a Fountain, a Rock of Strength, an Horn of Salvation; In God there is a complication of all excellencies; there are every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment freſh beauties and delights ſpringing from God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To make up bleſſedneſs there muſt be perfection<note n="*" place="margin">Beatitudo eſt ſtatus omnium honorum aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatione per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus. <hi>Boetius. Cicero.</hi>
                     </note>; the joy muſt be perfect, the glory perfect. Hebr. 12.23. <hi>Spirits of juſt men made perfect. Bonum conſtat ex inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro;</hi> if there be the leaſt defect, it deſtroys the nature of bleſſedneſs; as the leaſt ſymptom of a diſeaſe takes away the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and right temperature of the body.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. True bleſſedneſs muſt have Eternity ſtamped upon it. Bleſſedneſs is a fixed thing, it admits of no change or alteration. God ſaith of every child of his, <hi>I have bleſsed him, and he ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> As the Sunſhine of bleſſedneſs is <hi>without clouds,</hi> ſo it <hi>never ſets.</hi> Joh. 10 28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> Eternity is the higheſt link of the Chain of bleſſedneſs: Thus we have ſeen that this Diamond of bleſſedneſs is only to be found in the Rock of Ages. <hi>Bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>

                     </gap>im in the brain, which do not ſink into the heart, and thoſe do us no good: <hi>Chew the Cud:</hi> Let a Chriſtian think ſeriouſly with himſelf, There is a bleſſedneſs feaſible, and I am capable of enjoying it, if I do not lay bars in the way, and block up my own happineſs. Though <hi>within</hi> I ſee nothing but guilt, <hi>without</hi> nothing but curſes; yet there is a bleſſedneſs to be had, and to be had for <hi>me</hi> too in the uſe of means.</p>
                  <p>The ſerious meditation of this will be a forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make the ſinner break off his ſins by Repentance, and ſweat hard till he find the golden Mine of bleſſedneſs; I ſay, it would be the break-neck of ſin; how would a

man offer violence <hi>to himſelf</hi> by Mortification, and to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> by ſupplication, that at laſt he may arrive at a ſtate of bleſſedneſs. What, is there a Crown of bleſſedneſs to be ſet upon my head? a Crown hung with the Jewels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, delight, magnificence; a Crown reached out by God himſelf; and ſhall I by ſin hazard this? can the pleaſure of ſin countervail the loſs of bleſſedneſs? what more powerful Motive to Repentance than this. Sin will deceive me of the bleſſing! If a man knew certainly that a King would ſettle all his Crown-Revenues on him after ſuch a Term of years, would he offend that Regal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and cauſe him to reverſe and alter his Will?

Many tell us they are bound for heaven, but they ſteer their courſe a quite contrary way; the Divel is their Pilot, and they ſail hell-ward; as if a man ſhould ſay he were going a Voyage to the Eaſt, but ſails quite Weſt-ward. The Drunkard will tell you he hopes for bleſſedneſs, but he ſails another way; thou muſt go weeping to heaven, not reeling. The unclean perſon talks of bleſſedneſs, but he is fallen into that <hi>deep ditch,</hi> Prov. 23.27. where he is like ſooner to find hell, than heaven. A Beaſt may as well be made an Angel, as an unclean perſon in his Leproſie enter into the Paradiſe of God. The covetous perſon (of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>He is a worme, and no man,</hi> Pſal. 22.6. he is ever creeping in the earth, yet) he would lay a claim to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but can earth aſcend? Shall a lump of clay be made a bright Star in the Firmament of glory? be aſſured they ſhall never be bleſſed, who bleſs themſelves in their ſins; if ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. the ſinner <hi>bleſs himſelf, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine heart, to adde drunkenneſs to thirſt; the Lord
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168897:22"/>
will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven.</hi> A man can no more extract bleſſedneſſe out of ſin, than he can ſuck health out of poyſon. O let us lead <hi>bleſſed lives, and ſo declare plainly that we ſeek a country,</hi> Heb. 11, 14.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing that the godly are in ſome ſence already bleſſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now to the ſecond Aphoriſme, or Concluſion, that the godly are in ſome ſence already bleſſed. <hi>Bleſſed are</hi> —] the Saints are bleſſed not only when they are <hi>Comprehenſores,</hi> but while they are <hi>Viato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> They are bleſſed before they are crowned. This ſeems a Paradox to fleſh and blood; what reproached, and maligned, yet <hi>bleſſed!</hi> A man that looks upon the children of God with a carnal eye, and ſees how they are afflicted, and like the ſhip in the Goſpel, which was <hi>covered with waves,</hi> Matth. 8.24. would think they were far from bleſſedneſſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> brings a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. <hi>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I ſtoned, thrice I ſuffered ſhipwrack, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe Chriſtians of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, of whom the world was not worthy, <hi>had trial of cruel mockings and ſcourgings; they were ſawn aſunder, they were ſlaine with the ſword,</hi> Heb. 11.36, 37. What? and were all theſe during the time of their ſufferings <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</hi> A carnal man would think, If this be to be bleſſed, God deliver him from it.</p>
               <p>But, however ſence and reaſon would give their Vote, our Saviour Chriſt pronounceth the godly man <hi>bleſſed,</hi> though a Mourner, though a Martyr, yet <hi>bleſſed, Job</hi> on the dunghil was bleſſed <hi>Job.</hi> The Saints are bleſſed, when they are curſed. <hi>Shimei</hi> did curſe <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:168897:23"/>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. <hi>He came forth and curſed him;</hi> yet when he was curſed <hi>David,</hi> he was <hi>bleſſed David.</hi> The Saints though they are <hi>bruiſed,</hi> yet they are <hi>bleſſed.</hi> Not only they ſhall be bleſſed, but they are ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1. <hi>bleſſed are the undefiled.</hi> Pſal. 3.8. <hi>Thy bleſsing is upon thy people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How are the Saints <hi>already</hi> bleſſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In that they are enriched with heavenly bleſſings, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. They are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. not by an incorporation into the Divine eſſence, but by a transformation into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine likeneſſe. This is <hi>beatitudo inchoata,</hi> bleſſedneſſe begun; as the new-borne babe is ſaid to have life in it aſwell as he who is fully grown: So the Saints who are partakers of the Divine nature, have an inchoative bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though they have not arrived yet at perfection. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have <hi>Semen manens, The ſeed of God in them,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. And this is a ſeed of bleſſedneſſe. The Flower of glory grows out of the ſeed of grace; grace and glory differ, not in kind, but degree, the one is the root, the other the fruit; grace is glory in the dawning; and glory grace in the meridian; and in this ſence that aſſertion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is true, <hi>Beati ſumus fide, &amp; ſpe;</hi> grace is the firſt link of the chaine of bleſſedneſſe; now he that hath the firſt link of the chaine in his hand, hath the whole chaine. The Saints have the Spirit of God in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in us.</hi> How can the bleſſed Spirit be in a man and he not bleſſed? a godly mans heart is a Paradiſe, planted with the choiceſt fruit, and God himſelf walks in the midſt of this Paradiſe, and muſt he not needs be bleſſed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saints are already bleſſed, becauſe their ſins are not imputed to them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi> Gods not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168897:23"/>
iniquity, ſignifies Gods making of ſin not to be; 'tis as if the man had never ſinned; the debt-book is cancel'd in Chriſts blood; and if the debtor owe never ſo much, yet if the creditor croſs the book, it is as if he had never owed any thing. Gods not imputing ſin, is, that God will never call for the debt; or if it ſhould be called for, it ſhall be hid out of ſight. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. <hi>In thoſe days the iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found.</hi> Now ſuch a man who hath not ſin imputed to him, is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and the reaſon is, becauſe if ſin be not imputed to a man, then the curſe is taken away; and if the curſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, then he muſt needs be bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints are already bleſſed, becauſe they are in Covenant with God. This is clear, by comparing two Scriptures; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will be their God.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord:</hi> This is the crowning bleſſing, to have the Lord for our God; impoſſible it is to imagine that God ſhould be our God, and we not bleſſed. This ſweet word, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> implies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Propriety, that all that is in God ſhall be ours; his love ours, his Spirit ours, his mercy ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It implies all Relations. 1. Of a Father: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father unto you.</hi> The ſons of a Prince are happy; how bleſſed are the Saints who are of the true blood Royal? 2. It implies the relation of an Husband, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy husband.</hi> The Spouſe being contracted to her husband, is happy, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an intereſt in all he hath. The Saints being contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith are bleſſed, though the ſolemnity of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be kept for heaven. 3. It implies terms of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They who are in Covenant with God, are Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of heaven. <hi>Abraham my friend,</hi> Iſa. 41.8. 'Tis
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168897:24"/>
counted a Subjects happineſs to be in favour with his Prince, though he may live a while from Court; how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py muſt he needs be who is Gods Favourite?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints are already bleſſed, becauſe they have a Reverſion of heaven; as on the contrary, he who hath hell in Reverſion, is ſaid to be already condemned. <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> He is as ſure to be condemned, as if he were condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. So he who hath heaven in Reverſion, may be ſaid to be already bleſſed; a man that hath the Reverſion of an houſe, after a ſhort Leaſe is run out, he looks upon it as <hi>his</hi> already; this houſe (ſaith he) is mine: So a believer hath a Reverſion of heaven after the Leaſe of life is run out, and he can ſay at preſent, Chriſt is mine, and glory is mine; he hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> a title to heaven, and he is a bleſſed man that hath a title to ſhew; nay, faith turns the Reverſion into a Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Saints are already bleſſed, becauſe they have <hi>Primitias,</hi> the firſt fruits of bleſſedneſs here: We read of the <hi>earneſt of the Spirit, and the ſeal,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. and the <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> Rom. 8.23. Heaven is already begun in a believer. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Kingdome of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This Kingdome is in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers heart: <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. The people of God have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libation, and taſte of bleſſedneſs here. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> taſted a bunch of grapes before they were actually poſſeſſed of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> So the children of God have thoſe ſecret incomes of the Spirit, thoſe ſmiles of Chriſts face, thoſe kiſſes of his lips, thoſe love-tokens that are as <hi>bunches of grapes,</hi> and they think themſelves ſometimes in heaven. <hi>Paul was let down in a basket,</hi> Acts 9.25. Oftentimes the <hi>Comforter</hi> is let down to the ſoul in an Ordinance, and now the ſoul is in the Suburbs of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> above; a Chriſtian ſees heaven by <hi>faith,</hi> and taſts it by <hi>joy,</hi> and what is this but bleſſedneſs?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:168897:24"/>6. The Saints may be ſaid in this life to be bleſſed, becauſe all things tend to make them bleſſed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work for good to them that love God:</hi> We ſay to him that hath every thing falling out for the beſt, You are an happy man; the Saints are very happy, for all things haue a tendency to their good; proſperity doth them good, adverſity doth them good; nay, ſin turns to their good; every trip makes them more watchful; their maladies are their medicines; are not they happy perſons, that have every wind blowing them to the right Port?</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Saint may be ſaid to be bleſſed, becauſe part of him is already bleſſed; he is bleſſed in his <hi>head;</hi> Chriſt his head is in glory; Chriſt and believers make one body myſtical, their head is gotten into heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. <hi>Inform. Branch</hi> 1. See the difference between <label type="milestone">

He is not more full of <hi>ſin</hi> than he is of a <hi>curſe;</hi> though perhaps he bleſſeth himſelf in his wickedneſs, yet he is heir to Gods curſe; all the curſes of the Bible are his portion, and at the day of death this portion is ſure to be paid; but a godly man in the midſt of all his miſeries is bleſſed; he may be under the croſs, but not under a curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 2. It ſhews the priviledge of a believer; he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>2</label> not only ſhall be bleſſed, but he is bleſſed; bleſſedneſs is begun in him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.15. <hi>You are bleſsed of the Lord:</hi> Let the condition of the Righteous be never ſo ſad, yet it is bleſſed; he is bleſſed in affliction: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. <hi>Bleſſed is he whom thou chaſteneſt:</hi> Bleſſed in poverty: <hi>James</hi> 2.5.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168897:25"/>
                  <hi>Poor in the world, rich in faith.</hi> Bleſſed in diſgrace: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>The Spirit of God, and of glory reſteth upon you.</hi> This may be a cordial to the fainting Chriſtian! he is bleſsed in life and death, Satan cannot ſupplant him of the bleſſing.</p>

                  <hi>Branch</hi> 3. How may this take away murmuring and melancholy from a child of God? Wilt thou repine and be ſad when thou art bleſsed? <hi>Eſau</hi> wept becauſe he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.38. <hi>Bleſs me, even me alſo O my Father, and Eſau lift up his voice and wept.</hi> But ſhall a child of God be immoderately caſt down, when he hath the bleſſing? <hi>Adam</hi> ſin'd in the midſt of Paradiſe; how evil is it to be bleſſed, and yet murmure?</p>

What an encouragement is this to godlineſs? we are all ambitious of a bleſſing, then let us eſpouſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord.</hi> But you will ſay, this way is everywhere ſpoken againſt; 'tis no matter, ſeeing this is the way to get a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: Suppoſe a Rich man ſhould adopt another for his heir, and others ſhould reproach him, he cares not, as long as he is heir to the Eſtate: So, what though others may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thee for thy Religion, as long as it entails a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thee; the ſame day thou becomeſt godly, thou becomeſt bleſſed.</p>

                  </note>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve how Chriſts Doctrine and the opinion of carnal men differ. They think, <hi>beati divites, bleſſed are the rich;</hi> The world would count him bleſſed who could
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168897:26"/>
have <hi>Midas</hi> wiſh, that all he touch'd might be turn'd into gold. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Beati pauperes, bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit.</hi> The world thinks, Bleſſed are they on the <hi>Pinacle;</hi> but Chriſt pronounceth them bleſſed who are in the <hi>Valley;</hi> Chriſts reckonings and the worlds do not agree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve the nature of true Religion; Poverty leads the Van, and Perſecution brings up the Reare. <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus quaſi Crucianus.</hi> Every true Saint (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) is heire to the Croſſe! Some there are who would be thought religious, diſplaying Chriſts Colours by a glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but to be <hi>poor in ſpirit, and perſecuted, durus hic ſermo!</hi> they cannot take down this bitter pill; they would weare Chriſts Jewels, but wave his Croſſe; theſe are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Obſerve the certain connexion between grace and its reward; they who are <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> ſhall have the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> They are as ſure to go to heaven, as if they were in heaven already. Our Saviour would encourage men to Religion, by ſweetning Commands with Promiſes; he ties duty and reward together. As in the body, the veines carry the blood, and the arteries the ſpirits; ſo one part of theſe Verſes carries Duty, and the other part carries reward. As that Scholar of <hi>Apelles</hi> painted <hi>Helena</hi> rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn in coſtly and glorious apparel, hung all over with orient pearl, and precious ſtones. So our Lord Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet down ſeveral qualifications of a Chriſtian, <hi>poor in ſpirit, pure in heart,</hi> &amp;c. draws theſe heavenly vertues in their fair colours of <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> and ſets the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent crown of reward upon them, that by this oriency, he might the more ſet forth their unparallel'd beauty, and entice holy love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obſerve hence the concatenation of the graces, <hi>poor in ſpirit, meek, merciful, &amp;c.</hi> where there is one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168897:26"/>
grace, there is all. As they ſay of the Cardinal vertues, <hi>virtutes ſunt inter ſe connexae,</hi> the vertues are chained together; ſo we may ſay of the graces of the Spirit, they are link'd and chain'd together; he that hath poverty of Spirit, is a mourner; he that is a mourner, is meek; he that is meek, is merciful, &amp;c. The Spirit of God plants in the heart an habit of all the graces; the new creature hath all the parts and lineaments; as in the body there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all the Elements, and a mixture of all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. The graces of the Spirit are like a Row of pearl, which hang together upon the ſtring of Religion, and ſerve to adorn Chriſts Bride: This I note, to ſhew you a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between an hypocrite, and a true child of God: The hypocrite flatters himſelf with a pretence of grace; but in the mean time he hath not an habit of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he hath not poverty of ſpirit, nor purity of heart; whereas a child of God hath all the graces in his heart, at leaſt radically, though not gradually.

And this Crown the Saints ſhall wear, which is divinely orient and illuſtrious, exceeds all other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis more pure.</hi> Other Crowns, though they may be made of pure gold, yet they are <hi>mixed mettal,</hi> they have their troubles.

What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence, I may ſay of the Crown of glory, <hi>it addes no ſorrow with it</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 10.22.</note>. This Crown like <hi>Davids Harp,</hi> drives away the <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> of ſorrow and diſquiet; there can be no more grief in heaven, than there is joy in hell.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That mourning which will entitle a man to bleſſedneſſe, hath theſe qualifications.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſpontaneous and free; it muſt come as water out of a ſpring, not as fire out of a flint. Teares for ſin muſt be like the myrrhe which drops from the tree freely without cutting or forcing. <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> repentance was voluntary, <hi>ſhe stood weeping,</hi> Luke 7. She came to Chriſt with ointment in her hand, with love in her heart, with teares in her eyes; God is for a freewil-offering, he loves not to be put to diſtrain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Goſpel-mourning is ſpiritual; that is, when we mourn for ſinne more than ſuffering. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaith, <hi>Take away the plague,</hi> he never thought of the plague of his heart. A ſinner mourns becauſe judgement follows at the heeles of ſinne; but <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>my ſinne is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,</hi> Pſal. 51.

                  <p n="1">1. We muſt mourn for ſinne as it is an act of hoſtility and enmity. Sinne doth not only make us unlike God, but contrary to God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. <hi>and that they have walked contrary unto me.</hi> Sinne doth affront and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. Sinne is contrary to Gods nature; God is holy; ſinne is an impure thing; ſin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will; if God be of one minde, ſinne is of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſinne doth all it can to ſpight God. The Hebrew word for ſinne <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; now when we mourn for ſinne as it is a walking Antipodes to heaven, this is a Goſpel-mourning; nature will not bear contraries.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt mourn for ſin as it is a piece of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ingratitude; it is a kicking againſt the breaſts of mercy. God ſends his Sonne to redeeme us, his Spirit to comfort us; we ſinne againſt the blood of Chriſt, the grace of the Spirit, and ſhall we not mourn? We complaine of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe of others, and ſhall we not lay to heart our own unkindneſſe againſt God? <hi>Caeſar</hi> took it unkindly that his ſon <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhould ſtab him, <gap reason="foreign">

Grace tendred to them, <hi>Diabolus peccavit in innocentia constitutus, ego vero reſtitutus: ille perſtitit in malitia, Deo reprobante, ego vero Deo revocante; ille obduratur ad puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem, ego vero ad blandientem; &amp; ſic uterque contra Deum, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le contra non requirentem ſe, ego vero contra morientem pro me; ecce cujus imaginem horrebam, in multis aſpicio me hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribiliorem.</hi> Anſelm. <hi>de Caſu Diab.</hi> Now when we mourn for ſin as it hath its accent of ingratitude upon it, this is an Evangelical mourning,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt mourn for ſinne as it is a Privation; it keeps good things from us; it hinders our communion with God. <hi>Mary</hi> wept for Chriſts abſence, <hi>John</hi> 20.13. <hi>they have taken away my Lord.</hi> So, our ſinnes have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away our Lord; they have deprived us of his ſweet preſence. Will not he grieve who hath loſt a rich jewel? When we mourn for ſinne under this notion, as it makes the Sun of righteouſneſſe withdraw from our Horizon; when we mourn not ſo much that peace is gone, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is gone, but God is gone; <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. <hi>My beloved had withdrawn himſelf;</hi> this is an holy mourning; the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the loſſe of Gods favour, is the beſt way to regaine his favour. If thou haſt loſt a friend, all thy weeping will not fetch him again: but if thou haſt loſt Gods preſence, thy mourning will bring thy God again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Goſpel-mourning <hi>cogit ad Deum,</hi> it ſends the ſoul to God. When the Prodigal ſonne repented, he went to his father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18. <hi>I will ariſe and go unto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Jacob</hi> wept and prayed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3. The people of <hi>Iſrael wept</hi> and <hi>offered ſacrifice,</hi> Judg. 2.5. Goſpel-mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puts a man upon duty; the reaſon is, becauſe in true ſorrow there is a mixture of hope, and hope puts the ſoul upon the uſe or means; That mourning which like <hi>the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword,</hi> keeps the ſoul from approaching to God, and beats it off from duty, is a ſinful mourning; 'tis a ſorrow
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168897:44"/>
hatch'd in hell; ſuch was <hi>Sauls</hi> grief, which drove him to <hi>the Witch of Endor,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.7. Evangelical Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a ſpur to prayer; the childe who weeps for offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his father, goes into his preſence, and will not leave till his father be reconciled to him. <hi>Abſalom</hi> could not be quiet till <hi>he had ſeen the Kings face,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.32, 33.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Goſpel-Mourning is for ſin <hi>in particular: Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus verſatur in generalibus:</hi> It is with a true penitent as it is with a wounded man; he comes to the Chyrurgion, and ſhews him all his wounds; here I was cut with the Sword, here I was ſhot with a Bullet; So a true penitent bewails all his particular ſins: <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. <hi>We have ſerved Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alim;</hi> they mourned for their Idolatry: And <hi>David</hi> layes his finger upon the ſore, and points to that very ſin that troubled him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. I have done <hi>this evil;</hi> he means his blood-guiltineſs; a wicked man will ſay he is a ſinner; but a child of God ſaith, I have done <hi>this evil.

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving ſhewn the nature of Mourning, I ſhall next ſhew what is the Oppoſite to holy Mourning. The Oppoſite to Mourning, is <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> which in Scripture is called <hi>Cor lapideum, an heart of ſtone,</hi> Ezek. 36. An heart of ſtone is far from Mourning and Relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this heart of ſtone is known by two ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Inſenſibility:</hi> A ſtone is not ſenſible of any thing; lay weight upon it, grind it to powder, it doth not feel; ſo it is with an hard heart, it is inſenſible of ſin or wrath; the ſtone in the Kidneys is felt, but not the ſtone in the heart. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An heart of ſtone is known by its inflexibility: A ſtone will not bend; <hi>durum eſt quod non cedit tactui;</hi> ſo it is with an hard heart, it will not comply with Gods Command, it will not ſtoop to Chriſts Scepter; an heart of ſtone will ſooner break by death, than bend by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168897:50"/>
it is ſo far from yielding to God, that with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil it beats back the Hammer; it <hi>reſiſts the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7.51.</p>
                  <p>Oh Chriſtians, if you would be ſpiritual Mourners, take heed of this ſtone of the heart. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Harden not your hearts.</hi> A ſtony heart is the worſt heart; if it were bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, it might be melted in the furnace; if Iron, it might be bowed with the Hammer; but a ſtony heart is ſuch, that only the Arme of God can break, and the blood of God can ſoften. Oh the miſery of an hard heart! 1. An hard heart is void of all grace; while the Wax is hard, it will not take the impreſſion of the ſeal; the heart while it is hard, will not take the ſtamp of grace; it muſt firſt be made tender and melting; the Plow of the Word will not go upon an hard heart. 2. An hard heart is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to make fuel for hell-fire. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>After thy hardneſs of heart thou treaſureſt up wrath.</hi> Hell is full of hard hearts, there is not one ſoft heart there; there is weeping there, but no ſoftneſs: We read of <hi>Veſſels fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for deſtruction,</hi> Rom. 9.22. Impenitency fits theſe Veſſels for hell, and makes them like ſere Wood, which is fit to burn. 3. Hardneſs of heart makes a mans conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſe than all his other ſins beſides; if one be guilty of great ſins, yet if he can mourn, there is hope: Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unravels ſin, and makes ſin not to be; but hardneſs of heart binds guilt faſt upon the ſoul, it ſeals a man under wrath; it is not the hainouſneſs of ſin, but hardneſs of heart that damns; this makes the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt uncapable of mercy, becauſe the ſinner that hath committed it, is uncapable of Repentance.</p>

To adjourn, and put off mourning for ſin, is folly, in reſpect of the uncertainty of life; how doth the procraſtinating ſinner know that he ſhall live to be old? <hi>What is your life? it is but a vapour,</hi> James 4.14. how ſoone may ſickneſſe arreſt thee, and death ſtrike off thy head? may not thy ſun ſet at noone?

'Tis folly to put off all till laſt in reſpect of the improbability of finding mercy; though God give thee ſpace to repent, he may deny thee grace to repent. When God calls for mourning and thou art deaf, when thou calleſt for mercie God may be dumb, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 28.

That repentance is ſeldome true-hearted, which is gray-headed; 'Tis diſputable whether theſe Autumn-tears are not ſhed more out of fear of hell, than love to God. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner in a ſtorm throws his goods over-board, not but that he loves them, but he is afraid they will ſink the ſhip; when men fall to weeping-work late, and would caſt their ſins over-board, it is for the moſt part only for fear leſt they ſhould ſink the ſhip and drown in hell; 'Tis a great queſtion whether the ſick bed penitent doth not mourn becauſe he can keep his ſins no longer.

                     </note>; The comforts of the Saints are certain, they have the <hi>ſeal of the Spirit</hi> ſet to them. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. A ſeal is for confirmation; when a Deed is ſealed, it is firme, and unqueſtionable. When a Chriſtian hath the ſeal of the Spirit ſtamped upon his heart, now he is confirmed in the love of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein do theſe comforts of the Spirit which are unqueſtionably ſure, differ from thoſe which are falſe and pretended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three ways. 1. The comforts of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are laid in deep conviction, <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 8, <hi>and when he</hi> (that is, the Comforter, <hi>verſe</hi> 7.) <hi>is come, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,</hi> (or as the Greek word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he ſhall convince) <hi>the world of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth conviction go before conſolation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw</hi> Conviction fits for comfort; by conviction the Spirit doth ſweetly diſpoſe the heart to theſe two things. 1. To ſeek after Chriſt. When once the ſoul is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſin, and the hell that follows it, now a Saviour is precious. When the Spirit hath ſhot in the arrow of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, now ſaith a poor ſoul, where may I meet with Chriſt? In what Ordinance may I come to enjoy Chriſt? <hi>ſaw ye him whom my ſoul loves?</hi> All the world for one glimpſe of my Saviour. 2. The Spirit by conviction makes the heart willing to receive Chriſt upon his own termes: man, by nature, would article and indent with Chriſt; he would take half Chriſt; he would take him
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168897:63"/>
for a <hi>Saviour,</hi> not a <hi>Prince;</hi> he would accept of Chriſt as he hath <hi>an head of gold,</hi> Cant. 5.11. but not as he hath <hi>the government upon his ſhoulders,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. But when God lets looſe the ſpirit of bondage, and convinceth a ſinner of his loſt, undone condition, now he is content to have Chriſt upon any termes. When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck down to the ground by a ſpirit of conviction, he cries out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6. Let God propound what Articles he will, the ſoul will ſubſcribe to them. Now when a man is brought to Chriſts termes, to beleeve and obey, then he is fit for mercy; when the Spirit of God hath been a Spirit of <hi>conviction,</hi> then it becomes a ſpirit of <hi>conſolation;</hi> when the plough of the Law hath gone upon the heart, and broken up the fallow ground, now God ſows the ſeed of comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who brag of comfort, but were never yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, nor broken for ſin, have cauſe to ſuſpect their comfort to be a deluſion of Satan. It is like a mad mans joy, who fancies himſelf to be King, but it may be ſaid <hi>of his laughter, it is mad,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.2. The ſeed which wanted <hi>depth of earth,</hi> withered, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that comfort which wants <hi>depth of earth,</hi> deep humiliation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, will ſoone wither and come to nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God is a ſanctifying, before a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Spirit; as Gods Spirit is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> ſo he is called <hi>a ſpirit of grace,</hi> Zach. 12.10. Grace is the work of the Spirit, Comfort is the ſeal of the Spirit; the work of the Spirit goes before the ſeal; the graces of the ſpirit are compared to <hi>water,</hi> Iſa. 44.3. and the comforts of the ſpirit are compared to <hi>oyle,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. Firſt, God pours in the water of the ſpirit, and then comes the oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The oyle (in this ſence) runs above the water; Hereby we ſhall know whether our comforts are true and genuine. Some talk of the comforting ſpirit, who never
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168897:64"/>
had the ſanctifying Spirit; they boaſt of aſſurance, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had grace; theſe are ſpurious joyes, theſe comforts will leave men at death, they will end in horror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: Gods Spirit will never ſet ſeal to a Blank. Firſt, the heart muſt be an Epiſtle written with the finger of the Holy Ghoſt, and then it is <hi>ſealed with the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The comforts of the Spirit are humbling: Lord ſaith the ſoul, What am I that I ſhould have a ſmile from heaven, and that thou ſhouldeſt give me a privy ſeal of thy love? The more water is poured into a Bucket, the lower it deſcends; the fuller the ſhip is laden with ſweet ſpices, the lower it ſails; the more a Chriſtian is filled with the ſweet comforts of the Spirit, the lower he fails in humility; the fuller a Tree is of fruit, the lower the bough hangs; the more full we are of <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, joy and peace,</hi> Gal. 5.22. the more we bend down in humility. St. <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>choſen Veſſel</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 9.15.</note>, fill'd with the wine of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note>, did not more abound in joy, than in lowlineſs of mind. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Unto me who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, &amp;c.</hi> He who was the chief of the Apoſtles, calls himſelf the leaſt of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſay they have comfort, but are <hi>proud,</hi> they have learned to deſpiſe others, and are climb'd above Ordinances, their comforts are deluſions; the Divel is able not only to <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.4. but he can transform himſelf into the <hi>Comforter.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to counterfeit money, to ſilver over braſs, and put the Kings image upon it; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel can ſilver over falſe comforts, and make them look as if they had the ſtamp of the King of heaven upon them; the comforts of God are humbling; though they lift the heart up in thankfulneſs, yet they do not puff it up in pride.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:168897:64"/>2. The comforts God gives his Mourners, are unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they are not tempered with any bitter ingredients; worldly comforts are like wine that runs dregs; there is that guilt within checks and corrodes; <hi>in midſt of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heart is ſad,</hi> Prov: 14.13. <hi>Queen Mary</hi> once ſaid, if ſhe were opened, they would find <hi>Callis</hi> lying at her heart; if the breaſt of a ſinner were anatomized and opened, you would find a worm gnawing at his heart; guilt is a Wolf which feeds in the breaſt of his comfort; a ſinner may have a ſmiling countenance, but a chiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; his mirth is like the mirth of a man in debt, who is every houre in fear of arreſting; the comforts of wicked men are ſpiced with bitterneſs, they are worm-wood wine.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hi ſunt qui trepidant, &amp; ad omnia fulgura pallent,<note place="margin">Hor.</note>
                     </l>
                     <l>Cum tonat exanimes, primo quoque murmure coelum —</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But ſpiritual comforts are pure, they are not muddied with guilt, nor mixed with fear, they are the pure wine of the Spirit; what the Mourner feels is joy, and nothing but joy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe comforts God gives his Mourners, are <hi>ſweet.</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7. <hi>Truly the light is ſweet;</hi> ſo is the light of Gods countenance: How ſweet are thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which bring the <hi>Comforter</hi> along with them? <hi>John</hi> 14.16. Therefore the love of God ſhed into the heart, is ſaid to be <hi>better than wine,</hi> Cant. 1.2. Wine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the palate, but the love of God chears the conſcience; the <hi>lips</hi> of Chriſt <hi>drop ſweet ſmelling myrrhe,</hi> Cant. 5.13. The comforts God gives are a Chriſtians Muſick, they are the golden Pot and the Manna; the <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia</hi> of a Chriſtian; they are the Saints Feſtival, their banquetting ſtuffe; ſo ſweet are theſe Divine comforts,

that the Church had her <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe comforts from above are ſo ſweet, that they make all other comforts ſweet; health, eſtate, relations; they are like ſawce which makes all our earthly poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and enjoyments come off with a better reliſh. So ſweet are theſe comforts of the Spirit, that they do much abate and moderate our joy in worldly things; he who hath been drinking ſpirits of wine, or <hi>Alkermes,</hi> will not much thirſt after water: and that man who hath once <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted how ſweet the Lord is,</hi> Pſal. 34.8. and hath drunk the cordials of the Spirit, will not thirſt immoderately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecular delights. Thoſe who play with dogs and birds, it is a ſigne they have no children; ſuch as are inordinate in their deſire and love of the creature, declare plainly that they never had better comforts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe comforts which God gives his mourners are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts; they are call'd <hi>the comforts of the holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 9.31. Every thing propagates in its own kind<note n="*" place="margin">Omne agens operatur ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum naturam agens.</note>; the holy Ghoſt can no more produce impure joys in the ſoul, than the Sun can prduce darkneſſe; he who hath the comforts of the Spirit, looks upon himſelf as a perſon engaged to do God more ſervice; Hath the Lord looked upon me with a ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing face? I can never pray enough, I can never love God enough. The comforts of the Spirit raiſe in the heart an holy antipathy againſt ſin; the Dove hates every feather that hath grown upon the Hawke: ſo there is an hatred
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168897:65"/>
of every motion, and temptation to evil; he who hath a principle of life in him, oppoſeth every thing that would deſtroy life, he hates poiſon; ſo he that hath the comforts of the Spirit living in him, ſets himſelf againſt thoſe ſins which would murder his comforts; divine comforts give the ſoul more acquaintance with God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father and his Sonne Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The comforts reſerv'd for the mourners, are <hi>filling comforts,</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with joy,</hi> John 16.24. <hi>Ask that your joy may be full.</hi> When God pours in the joyes of heaven, they fill the heart, and make it run over, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am exceeding joyful,</hi> the Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="6">6. The comforts God gives his Mourners in this life, are <hi>glorious comforts.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Joy full of glory.</hi> 1.

                     </gap>, in oppoſition to other joyes, which compared with theſe, are inglorious and vile. A carnal mans joy, as it is aery and flaſhy, ſo it is ſordid, he ſucks nothing but dregs. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13. <hi>Ye rejoyce in a thing of naught.</hi> A carnal ſpirit rejoyceth, becauſe he can ſay this houſe is his, this eſtate is his; but a gracious ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth becauſe he can ſay this God is his. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.14. <hi>For this God is our God for ever and ever.</hi> The ground of a Chriſtians joy is glorious, he rejoyceth in that he is an heir of the promiſe; the joy of a godly man is made up of that which is the Angels joy, he triumphs in the light of Gods countenance; his joy is that which is Chriſts own joy; he rejoyceth in the myſtical union which is begun here, and conſummate in heaven: Thus the joy of the Saints is a joy <hi>full of glory.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Spiritual Mourners have a title to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet they may ſometimes want them. God is a free Agent, he will have the timing of our comforts; he hath <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a ſelf-freedom, to do what he will. The holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not be limited, he will reſerve his Prerogative to give or ſuſpend comfort, <hi>pro libitu;</hi> and if we are awhile without comfort, we muſt not quarrel with his diſpenſations; for as the Mariner is not to wrangle with Providence, becauſe the wind blows out of the Eaſt, when he deſires it to blow out of the Weſt; nor is the Husbandman to murmure, when God ſtops the bottles of heaven in time of drought; ſo neither is any man to diſpute or quarrel with God, when he ſtops the ſweet influence of comfort, but ought rather to acquieſce in his ſacred will.</p>
                  <p>But though the Lord might by vertue of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with-hold comfort from the Mourner, yet there may be many pregnant cauſes aſſigned why Mourners want comfort.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of God:</hi> He ſees it fit to with-hold comfort, 1. That he may raiſe the value of grace: We are apt to eſteem comfort above grace; therefore God locks up our comforts for a time, that he may inhance the price of grace; when farthings go better than gold, the King will call in farthings, that the price of gold may be the more raiſed. 2. God would have his people learn to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168897:68"/>
ſerve him for himſelf, and not for comfort only; it is <hi>amor Meretricius,</hi> an Harlot love, to love the husbands mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and tokens, more than his perſon; ſuch as ſerve God only for comfort, do not ſo much ſerve God, as ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Gods Mourners want comfort, it is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in regard of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Through miſtake, which is two-fold. 1. They go not to the right ſpring for comfort; they go to their tears, when they ſhould go to Chriſts blood; it is a kind of Idolatry to make our tears the ground of comfort; <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not meritorious;</hi> it is the way to joy, not the cauſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> got the bleſſing in the garments of his elder brother; true comfort flows out of Chriſts ſides; our tears are ſtained, till they are waſhed in the blood of Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In me peace.</hi> 2. Miſtake is, that Mourners are priviledged perſons, and may take more liberty; they may ſlacken the ſtrings of duty, and let looſe the reins to ſin: Chriſt hath indeed purchaſed a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for his people, but <hi>an holy liberty;</hi> not a liberty <hi>for</hi> ſin, but <hi>from</hi> ſin; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Ye are a Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a peculiar people;</hi> ye are not in a ſtate of <hi>ſlavery,</hi> but <hi>Royalty:</hi> What follows? do not make Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty a cloak for ſin. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs.</hi> If we quench the ſanctifying Spirit, God will quench the comforting Spirit; ſin is compared to a <hi>cloud,</hi> Iſa. 44.22. This cloud intercepts the light of Gods countenance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods Mourners ſometimes want comfort through diſcontent and peeviſhneſs. <hi>David</hi> makes his diſquiet the cauſe of his ſadneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> A diſquieted heart like a rough Sea, is not eaſily calmed; 'tis hard to make a troubled ſpirit receive comfort; this
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168897:68"/>
diſquiet ariſeth from various cauſes; ſometimes from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorrow and melancholy; ſometimes from a kind of envy; Gods people are troubled to ſee others have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and they want it; and now in a pet they refuſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and like a froward child, put away the breaſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. <hi>My ſoul refuſed to be comforted.</hi> Indeed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted ſpirit is no more fit for comfort, than a diſtracted man is fit for counſel; and whence is the Mourners diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but pride? as if God had not dealt well with him in ſtopping the influences of comfort; O Chriſtian, thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt be more humbled and broken before God empty out his golden oyle of joy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Mourner is without comfort, for want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the promiſes; he looks at that ſin which may humble him, but not at that Word which may comfort him. The Mourners eyes are ſo full of tears that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the promiſe; the vertue and comfort of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is in the applying; when the promiſes are applied by faith, they bring comfort: <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15, 16. Faith milks the breaſt of a promiſe. That Satan may hinder us of comfort it is his policy, either to keep the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from us, that we may not know it, or to keep us from the promiſe that we may not apply it. Never a promiſe in the Bible, but belongs to the Mourner, had he but the skill and dexterity of faith to lay hold on it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Mourner may want comfort, through too much earthly-mindedneſs; by feeding immoderately on earthly comforts, we miſs of heavenly comforts. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and I hid me.</hi> The earth puts out the fire; earthlineſs extinguiſheth the flame of divine joy in the ſoul; an Eclipſe is <hi>per inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem corporis Lunaris,</hi> when the Moon, which is a denſe body, comes between; the Moon is an Emblem of the world: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. when this comes between, then
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168897:69"/>
there is an Eclipſe in the light of Gods face; Such as dig in Mines, ſay there is ſuch a damp comes from the earth as puts out the light of a candle; earthly comforts ſend forth ſuch a damp as puts out the light of ſpiritual joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Perhaps the Mourner hath had comfort, and loſt it: <hi>Adams</hi> Rib was taken from him when he was aſleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. Our comforts are taken away when we fall aſleep in ſecurity; the Spouſe loſt her beloved when ſhe lay upon the bed of ſloath, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 6.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons Gods Mourners may want comfort; but that the ſpiritual Mourner may not be too much deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhall reach forth <hi>the cup of conſolation,</hi> Jer. 16.7. and ſpeak a few words that may comfort the Mourner in the want of comfort. 1. Jeſus Chriſt was without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, therefore no wonder if we are; our comforts are not better than his; he who was the Son of Gods love, was without the ſenſe of Gods love. 2. The Mourner hath a ſeed of comfort; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous. Light</hi> is a Metaphor put for <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>it is ſown:</hi> Though a child of God hath not comfort alwayes in the <hi>flowre,</hi> yet he hath in the <hi>ſeed;</hi> though he doth not feel comfort <hi>from</hi> God, yet he takes comfort <hi>in</hi> God. 3. A Chriſtian may be high in grace, and low in comfort; the high Mountains are without flowres; the Mines of gold have little or no corn growing on them; a Chriſtians heart may be a rich <hi>Mine</hi> of grace, though it be barren of comfort. 4. The Mourner is heir to comfort; and though <hi>for a ſmall moment</hi> God may <hi>forſake</hi> his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7. yet there is a time ſhortly coming, when the Mourner ſhall have all tears wiped away, and ſhall be brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of comfort; this joy is reſerved for heaven, and this brings me to the ſecond particular.</p>

It will be matter of joy at the <hi>Supper of the Lamb,</hi> that the Maſter of the Feaſt bids all his gueſts welcome; the Saints ſhall have the ſmiles of Gods face, the kiſſes of his lips; he will lead them into the wine-cellar, and diſplay the Banner of love over them.

Meekneſſe is oppoſed to <hi>haſtineſſe of ſpirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.9. <hi>Be not haſty in thy ſpirit to be angry, for anger reſts in the boſome of fools.</hi> When the heart boyls in paſſion, and anger (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) ſparkles forth in the eye, this is far from meekneſſe; <hi>anger reſts in the boſome of fools.</hi> Anger may be in a wiſe man, but it <hi>reſts</hi> in a foole. The angry man is like flax, or Gunpowder, no ſooner do you touch him but he is all on fire. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> calls anger drunkenneſſe; and <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith there are more drunken with paſſion, than with wine. <hi>Seneca</hi> calls anger <hi>brevis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſania,</hi> a ſhort fit of madneſſe; ſometimes it ſuſpends the uſe of reaſon; in the beſt things we are coole enough; in Religion we are all <hi>yce,</hi> in contention all fire.

I have read of two men that lived in malice, who being asked how they could ſay <hi>the Lords prayer?</hi> one anſwered, he thank'd God there were many good prayers beſides: The other anſwered, when he ſaid the Lords prayer, he did leave out thoſe words, <hi>As we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us:</hi> But Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in God replying, <hi>Becauſe thou doſt not ſay my prayer, therefore I will not hear thine</hi>

This I urge againſt thoſe who chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge one another to Duels; indeed ſpiritual Duels are lawful; it is good to fight with the Divel. <hi>James</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Divel:</hi> 'Tis good to Duel with a mans ſelf, the <hi>regenerate</hi> part againſt the <hi>carnal:</hi> Bleſſed is he that ſeeks a revenge upon his luſts. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Yea, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge?</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:168897:74"/>
— but other Duels are unlawful; <hi>Avenge not your ſelves.</hi> The Turks, though a barbarous people, did in Ancient times burn ſuch as went to Duel in their ſides with hot coals of fire; they who were in heat of revenge were puniſhed ſutably with fire.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if I am thus meek and tame, in bearing of injuries and incivilities, I ſhall loſe my credit, it will be a ſtain to my reputation?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To paſs by an injury without revenge, is no Eclipſe to a mans credit. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us it is the <hi>glory</hi> of a man to <hi>paſs over a tranſgreſſion,</hi> Prov. 12.11. 'Tis more honour to bury an injury, than revenge it; and to ſlight it, than to write it down †.<note n="*" place="margin">Melius eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurias ignoſcere quam vindicare.</note> The weakeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſooneſt turn head, and ſting upon every touch; the Lyon a more Majeſtick creature, is not eaſily provoked; the Bramble tears, the Oak and Cedar are more peaceable; paſſion imports weakneſs; a noble ſpirit over-looks an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Suppoſe a mans credit ſhould ſuffer an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair with thoſe whoſe cenſure is not to be valued; yet think, which is worſe, ſhame or ſin? Wilt thou ſin againſt God to ſave thy credit? ſurely it is little wiſdom for a man to adventure his blood, that he may fetch back his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to run into hell to be counted valorous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not but that a man may ſtand up in defence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <label type="milestone">

Some of the Anabaptiſts hold it unlawful to take up the ſword upon any occaſion, (though when they get the Power, I would be loth to truſt them, their river-water often turning to blood) but queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a man may take up the ſword for ſelf-preſervation; elſe he comes under the breach of the ſixth Commandment, he is guilty of ſelf-murder; in taking up the ſword he doth not ſo much ſeek anothers death, as the ſafe-guard of his own life; his intention is not to do hurt, but prevent it;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168897:75"/>
ſelf-defence is conſiſtent with Chriſtian meekneſs; the Law of Nature and Religion juſtifie it; that God who bids us <hi>put up our ſword,</hi> Matth. 26.51. yet will allow us a <hi>buckler</hi> in our own defence; and he that will have us <hi>innocent as Doves,</hi> not to offend others, will have us <hi>wiſe as ſerpents</hi> in preſerving our ſelves.</p>

Though a private perſon muſt not render to any man <hi>evil for evil,</hi> Rom. 12.17. yet a Magiſtrate may; the evil of puniſhment for the evil of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; this rendring of evil is good. Private men muſt <hi>put their ſword into the ſheath;</hi> but the Magiſtrate ſins if he doth not draw it out: As his ſword muſt not ſurfeit through cruelty, ſo neither muſt it ruſt through partiality: Too much lenity in a Magiſtrate, is not meekneſs, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; for him to indulge offences, and ſay with a gentle reproof as <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.23, 24. <hi>Why do you ſuch things? nay, my ſons, for it is no good report that I hear.</hi> This is but to ſhave the head that deſerves to be cut off; ſuch a Magiſtrate makes himſelf guilty.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The example of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Thy King cometh unto thee meek.</hi> Chriſt was the ſamplar and pattern of meekneſs. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. <hi>When he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he reviled not again.</hi> His enemies words were more bitter than the gall they gave him; but Chriſts words were ſmoother than oyle; he prayed, and wept for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; he calls to us to learn of him; <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek.</hi> Chriſt doth not bid us (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) learn of him to work miracles; to open the eyes of the blind, to raiſe the dead, but he would have us learn of him to be meek; if we do not imitate his life, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved by his death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us ſet before our eyes the examples of ſome of the Saints who have ſhined in this grace. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of unparallel'd meekneſs. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</hi> How many injuries did he put up? when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmured againſt him, inſtead of falling into a rage, he falls to prayer for them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.24, 25.

of an Angel to bear this; but behold <hi>Moſes</hi> his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he did not give them an unbecoming word! though they were in a ſtorm, he was in a calm; they chide, but he prayes. Oh that as the ſpirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> did reſt upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſo that ſome of the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes,</hi> this meek man, (or rather earthly Angel) may reſt upon us!

The examples of Heathens; though their meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not properly be called <hi>grace,</hi> becauſe it grew not upon the right ſtock of faith, yet it was beautiful in its kind. <hi>Pericles</hi> when one did revile him, and followed him home to his gate at night, rayling upon him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not a word, but commanded one of his ſervants to light a Torch, and bring the Raylor home to his own houſe. <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> when he was angry, would ſhut up himſelf in his Cloſet, and let none come near him till he had maſtered his paſſion. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> if they had chanced to fall out in the day, they would embrace and be friends ere Sun-ſet. <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in one of his Orations reports of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, he was a man of <hi>a meek diſpoſition,</hi> he admitted all to come to him ſo freely, and heard the complaints of them that were wronged, ſo mildly, that he excelled all the Princes before him; he was of that ſweet temper, that it was hard to ſay whether his enemies did more fear his valour, or his ſubjects love his meekneſs. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> not only forgave

                     <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius</hi> his enemies, but advanced them; he thought himſelf moſt honoured by acts of clemency and meekneſs.

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That God can fill the hungry ſoul; he is called a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fountain. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>With thee is the fountain of life:</hi> The Ciſtern may be empty, and cannot fill us: Creatures are oft <hi>broken Ciſterns,</hi> Jer. 2.13. But the fountain is filling; God is a <hi>Fountain;</hi> if we bring the Veſſels of our deſires to this Fountain, he is able to fill them; the fulneſs in God is, 1. <hi>An infinite fulneſs;</hi> though he fill us, and the Angels which have larger capacities to receive, yet he hath never the leſs himſelf; as the Sun, though it ſhines, hath never the leſs light. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.46. <hi>I perceive that vertue is gone out of me.</hi> Though God lets <hi>vertue
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168897:94"/>
go out of him,</hi> yet he hath never the leſs; the fulneſs of the creature is <hi>limited;</hi> it ariſeth juſt to ſuch a degree and proportion, but Gods fulneſs is infinite; as it hath its <hi>Reſplendency,</hi> ſo its <hi>Redundancy,</hi> it knows neither bounds nor bottom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>conſtant fulneſs:</hi> The fulneſs of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a mutable fulneſs, it ebbs and changeth. I could (ſaith one) have helped you, but now my Eſtate is low; the bloſſoms of the Fig-tree are ſoon blown off; creatures cannot do that for us which once they could; but God is a conſtant fulneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27. <hi>Thou art the ſame:</hi> God can never be exhauſted, his fulneſs is over-flowing and ever-flowing then ſurely <hi>it is good to draw nigh to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28. it is good bringing our Veſſels to this ſpring-head, 'tis a never-failing goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Why God doth fill the hungry ſoul. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. God will fill the hungry ſoul out of his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; he knows elſe <hi>the Spirit would fail before him, and the ſoul which he hath made,</hi> Iſa. 57.16. If the hungry man be not ſatisfied with food, he dyes; God hath more bowels than to ſuffer an hungry ſoul to be famiſhed; when the Multitude had nothing to eat, Chriſt was <hi>moved with compaſſion,</hi> and he wrought a miracle for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.32. Much more will he compaſſionate ſuch as <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs:</hi> When a poor ſinner ſees himſelf almoſt ſtarved in his ſins, (as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> among his husks) and begins to hunger after Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>There is bread enough in my Fathers houſe;</hi> God will then out of his infinite compaſſions bring forth the <hi>fatted Calf,</hi> and refreſh this ſoul with the delicacies and proviſions of the Goſpel; oh the melting of Gods bowels to an <hi>hungry ſinner!</hi> Hoſea 11.8. <hi>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168897:94"/>
ſee a poor creature at the door ready to periſh with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but our bowels begin to relent, and we afford them ſome relief; and will <hi>the Father of mercies</hi> let a poor ſoul that hungers after the bleſſings of the Goſpel go away without an Alms of free-grace? no, he will not, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; let the hungry ſinner think thus, Though I am full of <hi>wants,</hi> yet my God is full of <hi>bowels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God will fill the hungry that he may fulfill his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Word. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.21. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye that hunger now, for ye ſhall be filled.</hi> Iſa. 44.3. I <hi>will poure water upon him that is thirſty, I will poure my Spirit upon thy ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> Hath the Lord ſpoken, and ſhall it not come to paſs? promiſes are obligatory; if God hath paſſed a promiſe, he cannot go back: Thou that hungereſt after righteouſneſs, haſt God engaged for thee; he hath (to ſpeak with Reverence) pawned his truth for thee. As <hi>his compaſſions fail not,</hi> Lam. 3.22. ſo <hi>he will not ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. If the hungry ſoul ſhould not be filled, the promiſe ſhould not be fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God will fill the hungry ſoul, becauſe he himſelf hath excited and ſtirred up this hunger; he plants holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in us, and will not he ſatisfie thoſe deſires which he himſelf hath wrought in us? as in caſe of <hi>prayer,</hi> when God prepares the heart to pray, he prepares his ear to hear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.10. So in caſe of <hi>ſpiritual hunger,</hi> when God prepares the heart to hunger, he will prepare his hand to fill; it is not rational to imagine that God ſhould deny to ſatisfie that hunger which he himſelf hath cauſed: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth nothing in vain:</hi> Should the Lord inflame the deſire after righteouſneſs, and not fill it, he might ſeem to do ſomething in vain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God will fill the hungry, from thoſe ſweet Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſtands unto them, they are his <hi>children;</hi> we cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:168897:95"/>
deny our children when they are hungry, we will rather ſpare it from our ſelves: <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. When he that is <hi>born of God,</hi> ſhall come and ſay, <hi>Father,</hi> I hunger, give me Chriſt; <hi>Father,</hi> I thirſt, refreſh me with the living ſtreams of thy Spirit, can God deny? Doth God hear the <hi>Raven</hi> when it cries, and will he not hear the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> when they cry? when the Earth opens its mouth and thirſts, God doth ſatisfie it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.9, 10. Doth the Lord ſatisfie the thirſty Earth with ſhowres, and will he not ſatisfie the thirſty ſoul with grace?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. God will ſatisfie the hungry, becauſe the hungry ſoul is moſt thankful for mercy; when the reſtleſs deſire hath been drawn out after God, and God fills it, how thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is a Chriſtian! The Lord loves to beſtow his mercy where he may have moſt praiſe; we delight to give to them that are thankful: Muſitians love to play where there is the beſt ſound; God loves to beſtow his mercies where he may hear of them again: The hungry ſoul ſets the Crown of praiſe upon the head of free-grace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>Who ſo offereth praiſe, glorifies me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. How God fills the hungry ſoul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a three fold filling.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. With Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. With Peace.</item>
                  <item>3. With Bliſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. God fills the hungry ſoul with <hi>Grace:</hi> Grace is filling, becauſe ſutable to the ſoul. <hi>Stephen full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7.55. This <hi>fulneſs</hi> of Grace is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>parts,</hi> not of <hi>degrees.</hi> There is ſomething of every Grace, though not perfection in any Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God fills the hungry ſoul with <hi>peace.</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with joy and peace;</hi> this flows from Chriſt. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had honey out of the Rock; this honey of peace comes out of the Rock Chriſt. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:168897:95"/>
16. <hi>ult. that in me ye might have peace.</hi> So filling is this peace, that it ſets the ſoul a longing after heaven; this <hi>Cluſter of Grapes</hi> quickens the appetite and purſuit after the full Crop.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God fills the hungry ſoul with <hi>bliſs:</hi> Glory is a filling thing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult. When I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy image.</hi> When a Chriſtian awakes out of the ſleep of death, then he ſhall be ſatisfied, having the glorious beams of Gods image ſhining upon him; then ſhall the ſoul be filled brim-full; the glory of heaven is ſo ſweet, that the ſoul ſhall ſtill thirſt; yet ſo infinite, that it ſhall be filled.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Qui te Chriſte bibent, dulci torrente refecti</l>

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> What an Encouragement is this to hunger after righteouſneſs! ſuch ſhall be filled:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>
                  </label> God chargeth <hi>us</hi> to fill the hungry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.10. He blames thoſe who do not fill the hungry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.6. And do we think he will be ſlack in that which he blames us for not doing? Oh come with hungrings after Chriſt, and be aſſured of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. God keeps open houſe for hungry ſinners; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites his Gueſts, and bids them come <hi>without money,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. Gods Nature inclines him, and his Promiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him to fill the hungry. Conſider, Why did Chriſt receive <hi>the Spirit without meaſure?</hi> John 3.34. It was not for himſelf; he was infinitely full before; but he was filled with the <hi>holy unction</hi> for this end, that he might diſtill his grace upon the hungry ſoul. Art thou <hi>ignorant?</hi> Chriſt was filled with wiſdom that he might teach thee. Art thou <hi>polluted?</hi> Chriſt was filled with grace that he might cleanſe thee: Shall not the ſoul then come to Chriſt, who was filled on purpoſe to fill the hungry? we love to knock
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:168897:96"/>
at a rich mans door; in our Fathers houſe there is <hi>bread enough;</hi> come with deſire, and you ſhall go away with comfort; you ſhall have the vertues of Chriſts blood, the influences of his Spirit, the communications of his love.</p>
               <p>Here are two Objections made againſt this.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thou ſayſt thou hungereſt, and art not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; perhaps God is not ſatisfied with thy hunger; thou haſt <hi>opened thy mouth wide</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 81.10.</note>, but haſt not <hi>opened thine ear</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 40.9.</note>: When God hath called thee to Family-prayer, and mortification of ſin, thou haſt like the <hi>deaf Adder,</hi> ſtopped thine ear againſt God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11. No wonder then thou haſt not that comfortable filling as thou deſireſt; though thou haſt opened thy mouth, yet thou haſt ſtopped thine ear; the child that will not hear his parent, is made to do pennance by faſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perhaps thou thirſteſt as much after a tentation as after righteouſneſs: At a Sacrament thou ſeemeſt to be inflamed with deſire after Chriſt; but the next tentation that comes, either to drunkenneſs or laſciviouſneſs, thou falleſt in, and cloſeſt with the tentation. Satan doth but beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to thee, and thou comeſt; thou openeſt faſter to the Tempter than to Chriſt; and doſt thou won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thou art not filled with the fat things of Gods houſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perhaps thou hungereſt more after the world than after righteouſneſs: The young man in the Goſpel would have Chriſt, but the world lay nearer his heart than Chriſt: hypocrites pant more after the <hi>duſt of the Earth</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Amos 2.7.</note> than the <hi>water of life. Iſrael</hi> had no Manna while their Dough laſted; ſuch as feed immoderately upon the Dough of <hi>earthly things,</hi> muſt not think to be fill'd with Manna

from heaven; if your <hi>money</hi> be your god, never look to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another God in the Sacrament.</p>

Look into thy heart, and ſee the diſtillations of the Spirit; the dew may fall, though the honey-comb doth not drop.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Love and mercy differ thus; Love is more extenſive; the Dioceſs that Love walks and viſits in, is larger: Mercy properly reſpects them that are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; Love is of a larger conſideration; Love is like a friend

Again, Love acts more out of <hi>affection;</hi> Mercy acts out of a principle of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> Mercy lends its help to another, Love gives its heart to another: Thus they differ; but Love and Mercy agree in this, they are both ready to do good Offices; both of them have ſoundings of bowels, and healing under their wings.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. WE muſt be merciful to the <hi>ſouls</hi> of others; this is <hi>Spiritualis Eleemoſyna,</hi> a ſpiritual Almes. Indeed ſoul-mercy is the chief; the ſoul is the moſt precious thing; it is a veſſel of honour, 'tis a bud of eternity, 'tis a ſparkle lighted by the breath of God, 'tis a rich Diamond ſet in a Ring of clay; the ſoul hath the blood of God to redeem it, the image of God to beautifie it; it being therefore of ſo high a deſcent, ſprung from <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of dayes,</hi> that mercy which is ſhewn to the ſoul, muſt needs be the greateſt.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168897:99"/>
pity. <hi>Mark</hi> 5.5. To ſee a ſinner <hi>ſtabbing</hi> himſelf, and having his hands imbrued in his own blood, ſhould cauſe relentings in our bowels; <hi>our eye ſhould affect our heart:</hi> God was angry with <hi>Edom,</hi> becauſe, he <hi>did caſt off all pity,</hi> Amos 1.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Soul-mercy is in <hi>adviſing and exhorting</hi> ſinners: Tell them in what a ſad condition they are, <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs.</hi> Shew them their danger, they tread upon the banks of the bottomleſs pit; if death gives them a jog, they tumble in; and we muſt dip our words in honey, uſe all the mildneſs we can. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>In meekneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing,</hi> &amp;c. Fire melts, oyntment mollifies; words of love may melt hard hearts into Repentance; this is ſoul-mercy: God made a Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.5. that whoſoever did ſee <hi>his enemies Aſs lying under a burden, he ſhould help him.</hi> On which words ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> We will help a Beaſt that is fallen under a burden; and ſhall we not extend relief to thoſe who are fallen under a worſe burden of ſin?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Soul-mercy is in <hi>reproving</hi> refractory ſinners; there is a <hi>cruel</hi> mercy, when we ſee men go on in ſin, and we let them alone; and there is a merciful cruelty, when we are ſharp againſt mens ſins, and will not let them go to hell quietly. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thy heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> Fond pity is no better than cruelty: <hi>Titus</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rebuke them ſharply;</hi>

                     </gap>, cuttingly; the Chyrurgion cuts and lanceth the fleſh, but it is in order to a cure, they are healing wounds; ſo by a cutting reproof, when we lance mens conſciences, and let out the blood of ſin, we exerciſe ſpiritual Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, this is ſhewing mercy. <hi>Jude</hi> 23. <hi>Others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> If a man were in the fire, though you did hurt him a little in pulling him
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168897:99"/>
out, he would be thankful, and take it as a kindneſſe. Some men when we tell them of ſin, ſay, <hi>O this is bitterneſſe;</hi> no, it is <hi>ſhewing mercy.</hi> If a mans houſe were on fire, and another ſhould ſee it, and not tell him of it for fear of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, were not this cruelty? when we ſee others <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſleep of death,</hi> and the fire of Gods wrath ready to burn about their ears, and we are ſilent, is not this to be acceſſory to their death?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Soul-mercy is in <hi>praying</hi> for others. This is like phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick uſed in a deſperate caſe, and oft it recovers the ſick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man avails much;</hi> as it cures the ſick body, ſo the ſin-ſick ſoul. There is a ſtory of one who gave his ſoul to the Divel, who was given in to the prayers of <hi>Luther.</hi> When <hi>Eutychus fell down from an high loft, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up dead, Paul fell on him</hi>

There is a <hi>Primitive</hi> Purity which is in God Originally and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially as light is in the Sun.

               <p n="2">2. There is a created Purity; Thus holineſſe is in the Angels, and was once in <hi>Adam; Adams</hi> heart had not the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:168897:118"/>
leaſt ſpot or tincture of impurity. We call that wine pure which hath no ſophiſtication; and that gold pure which hath no droſſe mingled with it. Such was <hi>Adams</hi> holineſſe, it was like the wine which comes from the grape, having no mixture; but this is not to be found on earth, we muſt go to heaven for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an <hi>evangelical</hi> purity; when grace is mingled with ſome ſin; like Gold in the Oare, like aire in the twilight, like wine that hath a daſh in it, like fine cloth with a courſe liſt; like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, <hi>part of ſilver</hi> and <hi>part of clay,</hi> Dan. 2.35. This mixture God calls <hi>purity</hi> in a Goſpel-ſence; as a face may be ſaid to be fair which hath ſome freckles in it. Where there is a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of purity, and a loathing our ſelves for our impurity, this is to be <hi>pure in heart.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Profeſsion</hi> is not purity; a man may have a <hi>name to live,</hi> and <hi>yet be dead,</hi> Rev. 3.1. He may be <hi>ſwept</hi> by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and <hi>garniſhed</hi> by profeſſion, yet the Divel may dwell in the houſe.

                  </gap>, <hi>filthineſs, James</hi> 1.21. And to ſhew how befilthying a thing it is, 'tis compar'd to a <hi>plague-ſoar,</hi> 1 Kings 8.38. To <hi>ſpots, Deut.</hi> 32.5. To a <hi>vomit,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.22. To the infants <hi>tumbling in blood,</hi> Ezek. 16.6. To a <hi>menſtruous cloath, Iſa.</hi> 30.22. which (as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith) was the moſt defiling thing under the Law. All the legal waſhings which God
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168897:119"/>
appointed, were but to put men in mind of their loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe before they were waſhed in the blood of Chriſt. If all the evils in the world were put together, and their quinteſcence ſtrain'd out, they could not make a thing ſo black and polluted as ſin doth; a ſinner is a Divel in mans ſhape. When <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod was turn'd into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he fled from it; would God open mens eyes, and ſhew them their deformities, and damnable ſpots, they would be afraid, and flie from themſelves as Serpents! This ſhews what need we have of <hi>Purity.</hi> When grace comes it waſheth off this helliſh filth, of <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> it maks us <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> it turns Ravens into Swans; it makes them who are as black as hell, to become white as ſnow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe none but the pure in heart are intereſted in the Covenant of Grace; covenanted perſons have <hi>the ſprinkling with clean water,</hi> Ezek. 36.25. Now, till we are thus <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> we have nothing to do with the new Covenant, and by conſequence, with the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If a <hi>Will</hi> be made only to ſuch perſons as are ſo qualified, none can come in for a part, but ſuch as have thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications. So, God hath made a Will and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that he will be our God, and will ſettle heaven upon us by entaile, but with this clauſe, or <hi>proviſo</hi> in the Will, that we be purified perſons, having <hi>the clean water ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> upon us; Now till then, we have nothing to do with God, or mercie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Purity is the end of our election, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us that we ſhould be holy;</hi> not <hi>for</hi> holineſſe, <hi>to</hi> holineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.</hi> God predeſtinates us to <hi>Chriſts image,</hi> which image con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts <hi>in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. So that till thou art holy thou canſt not ſhew any ſigne of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:168897:120"/>
election upon thee, but rather the Divels brand-mark.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Purity is the end of our redemption; if we could have gone to heaven in our ſins, Chriſt needed not have died. Why did he ſhed his blood but to redeem us <hi>from a vain converſation?</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. and <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people;</hi> Chriſt ſhed his blood to waſh off our filth; the Croſſe was both an <hi>Altar</hi> and a <hi>Lavor.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt died not only to ſave us <hi>from wrath,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> but to ſave us <hi>from ſin,</hi> Matth. 1.21. Out of his ſides came <hi>water,</hi> which ſignifies our cleanſing as well as <hi>blood,</hi> which ſignifies our juſtifying, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. The truth is, it were to make the body of Chriſt monſtrous, if the head ſhould be pure and not the members.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">2. Reaſons for heart-purity.</note>2. Why Purity muſt be chiefly in the heart. 1. Becauſe if the heart be not pure, we differ nothing from a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Purity; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> holineſſe did conſiſt chiefly in externals; theirs was an outſide Purity, they never minded the inſide of the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye make cleane the outſide of the cup and of the platter, but within ye are full of extortion;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>Ye are like unto whited Sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens bones.</hi> The Phariſees were good only in <hi>ſuperficie,</hi> they were not <hi>Albi,</hi> but <hi>dealbati, whited over,</hi> not <hi>white;</hi> they were like a rotten poſt laid in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion colour; like a fair Chimny-piece guilded without, but within nothing but Soot. O ſuch Hypocrites <hi>Salvian</hi> complains of, who had Chriſt in their mouths, but to no purpoſe; we muſt go farther, be <hi>pure in heart,</hi> like the Kings daughter, <hi>all glorious within,</hi> Pſal. 45.13. Elſe ours is but a phariſaical purity; and Chriſt faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:168897:120"/>
of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The heart muſt eſpecially be kept pure, becauſe the heart is the chief ſeat, or place of Gods reſidence. God dwells in the heart, he takes up the heart for his own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. therefore it muſt be pure and holy. A Kings Palace muſt be kept from defilement, eſpecially his Preſence-chamber; The heart is Gods Preſence-chamber, How holy ought that to be? If the body be the Temple of the holy Ghoſt†,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19.</note> the heart is the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum;</hi> Oh take heed of defiling the room where God is to come, let that room be waſhed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tears.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The heart muſt eſpecially be pure, becauſe it is the heart ſanctifies all we do; if the heart be holy, all is holy, our affections holy, our duties holy, <hi>The Altar ſanctified the gift</hi>

He fains himſelf ſick, and his ſiſter <hi>Tamar</hi> muſt be his Nurſe, ſhe muſt cook and dreſs his meat for him, by which means he defiled the breaſts of her Virginity; it is ſad when mens care is not to diſcharge conſcience, but to ſatisfie luſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>Firſt, He ſerves God with the <hi>heart.</hi> The Hypocrite doth but make a ſhew of obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins;</hi> there may be a fair complexion, when the Lungs and Vitals are rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Hypocrite is fair to look on, he hath a devout eye, but a hollow heart; but he who is ſincere, his inſide is his beſt ſide. In the Law God would have the <hi>inwards offered up,</hi> Levit. 4.11. A good Chriſtian gives God the <hi>inwards;</hi> when he prays his heart prays, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah prayed in her heart.</hi> In his Thankſgivings the heart is the chief inſtrument of praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.1. Then is the ſweeteſt muſick when we <hi>make melody in our hearts to the Lord,</hi> Col. 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſincere Chriſtian ſerves God with the <hi>whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.2. Hypocrites have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2. An heart for God, and an heart for ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is divided;</hi> God loves a <hi>broken</hi> heart, but not a <hi>divided</hi> heart; an upright heart is a whole heart; the full ſtraine and torrent of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions runs out after God; a ſincere heart <hi>follows God ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Num. 14.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſincere heart is willing to come under a trial, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23. <hi>Search me O God, and try me;</hi> That mettal is to be ſuſpected which men are afraid to bring to the Touch-ſtone; a ſound heart likes the Touch-ſtone of the

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tertul.</note>, they flie from that light which would diſcover ſin; they hate that Phyſick of the Word which meeting with their ill humours, begins to make them ſick, and trouble their conſcience. A gracious ſoul loves that preaching beſt which makes an Heart-Anatomy.</p>
                  <p>3ly. A ſincere heart dares not act in the leaſt againſt his conſcience; he is the moſt magnanimous, yet the moſt puſillanimous; he is bold in ſuffering, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.1. but fearful of ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. He dares not get an eſtate by ſinful ſhifts, or riſe upon the ruines of another. <hi>Jacob</hi> got his fathers bleſſing by fraud; but that is not the way to get Gods bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a ſincere heart is a ſuſpitious heart. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite ſuſpects others, and hath charitable thoughts of himſelf; the ſincere Chriſtian hath charitable thoughts of others, and ſuſpects himſelf; he calls himſelf often to account, O my ſoul, haſt thou any Evidences for Heaven? are they not to ſeek when they ſhould be to ſhew? Is there no flaw in thy Evidences? thou mayeſt miſtake common grace for ſaving. Weeds in the Corn-fields look like flowres. The fooliſh Virgins Lamps looked as if they had oyle in them; O my ſoul, is it not ſo with thee? The ſincere ſoul being ever jealous, playes the Critick upon himſelf, and doth ſo traverſe things in the Court of conſcience, as if he were preſently to be cited to Gods Bar. This is to be <hi>pure in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A pure heart breaths after purity. If God ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtretch out the golden Scepter, and ſay to him, <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given thee to half the Kingdom;</hi> he would ſay, <hi>Lord, a pure heart;</hi> let my heart have this inſcription, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord;</hi> let my heart be thy Temple, and do thou dwell in it. Lord, what ſhould I do in heaven with this unholy heart? what converſe could I have with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:168897:127"/>
God or Angels? A gracious ſoul is ſo in love with puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he prizeth a pure heart above all bleſſings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Above riches;</hi> he knows he may be cloathed <hi>in purple and fine linnen,</hi> and yet go to hell<note n="*" place="margin">Divitiae ſunt in ſiniſtra Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note>; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be <hi>poor,</hi> ſo he may be <hi>pure;</hi> he knows heart-purity is a ſpecial Certificate of Gods love, <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Above gifts;</hi> gifts do not at all ſet us off in Gods eye; a pure heart is the jewel. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. <hi>O woman great is thy faith!</hi> It was not her Rhetorical language Chriſt was taken with, but her faith. Hypocrites have had rare gifts; <hi>Saul</hi> had the ſpirit of Propheſie; <hi>Judas</hi> no doubt could make an Elegant Oration. Hypocrites have come into Gods Church loaden with Egyptian gold; <hi>videl Humane learning:</hi> There may be Illumination with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sanctification. A ſmall Diamond is better than a great deal of braſs: A little grace excels the moſt flouriſhing parts. Now if the out-goings of thy ſoul are after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, thou deſireſt rather a <hi>pure heart,</hi> than an <hi>eloquent tongue;</hi> thou haſt the oyle of the Spirit poured on thee, and thou ſhalt be crowned with a ſight of God.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. A pure heart abhors all ſin: A man may forbear and forſake ſin, yet not have a pure heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He may <hi>forbear ſin;</hi> as one may hold his breath while he dives under water, and then take breath again: And a man may forbear ſin: 1. <hi>For want of occaſion;</hi> The Gun-powder makes no noiſe till the fire be put to it; the Clock ſtands ſtill till the Weights are put on. Let a tentation come, which is like the hanging on of the Weights, and the heart goes as faſt in ſin as ever. 2. He may forbear ſin, <hi>formidine poenae, for fear.</hi> A man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears a Diſh he loves, for fear it ſhould bring his diſeaſe upon him of the <hi>ſtone</hi> or <hi>gout.</hi> There is a conflict in a ſinner between the paſſion of <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>fear.</hi> Deſire
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168897:127"/>
ſpurs him on to ſin, but fear as a Curben-bit checks him; nor is it the crookedneſs of the Serpent he fears, but the ſting of the Serpent. 3. He may forbear ſin out of a deſign; he hath a plot in hand, and his ſin might ſpoile his plot. Some rich heir would flie out in exceſs, but he carries it fair to prevent a cutting off the Entail. How good was <hi>Joaſh</hi> while <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt lived! <hi>Prudence</hi> as well as <hi>Conſcience</hi> may reſtraine from ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man may forſake ſin, yet not have a pure heart; it is a great matter I confeſs to forſake ſin; ſo dear is ſin to men, that they will part with <hi>the fruit of their body</hi> for the ſin of their ſouls†.<note n="*" place="margin">Micah 6.7.</note> Sin is the <hi>Dalilah</hi> that doth bewitch, and it is much to ſee men divorced from it; this is ſome fruit of the Miniſtry to civilize; but there may be a forſaking of ſin, yet no heart-purity; ſin may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken upon wrong principles. 1. From <hi>Morality.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arguments may ſuppreſs ſin: I have read of a debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heathen, who hearing <hi>Socrates</hi> read an Ethick Lecture of Vertue and Vice, (though he came with a purpoſe to deride <hi>Socrates,</hi> yet) he went away changed, and did no more follow his former Exorbitancies. <hi>Cato, Seneca, Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> ſeeing a beauty in Vertue, did lead unblameable lives. 2. From <hi>Policy.</hi> A man may forſake ſin, not out of reſpect to Gods glory, but his own credit. Vice will waſte his Eſtate, eclipſe the honour of his Family, therefore out of policy he will divorce his ſin. 3. From <hi>Neceſſity.</hi> Perhaps he can now follow the Trade of ſin no longer; the Adulterer is grown old, the Drunkard poor; his heart is to ſin, but either his purſe fails him, or his ſtrength; as a man that loves Hunting, but his Priſon-fetters will not ſuffer him to follow the ſport. This man who is neceſſitated to put a ſtop to ſin, doth not ſo much forſake ſin, as ſin forſakes him.</p>

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:168897:128"/>But now he is pure in Gods eye who <hi>abhors</hi> ſin. Pſal. 119.104. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> This is excellent indeed, becauſe now <hi>the love of ſin is crucified.</hi> A hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may leave ſin, yet love it; as the Serpent caſts her coat, yet keeps her ſting; but when a man can ſay he abhors ſin, now ſin is killed in the root; a pure heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from ſin, as a man doth from a Diſh that he hath an antipathy againſt. This is a ſign of a <hi>new nature,</hi> when a man hates what once he loved; and becauſe he hates ſin, therefore he fights againſt it with <hi>the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> as a man that hates a Serpent, ſeeks the deſtruction of it.</p>

                     </gap>, from all <hi>ſhew</hi> of evil. A pure heart avoids that which may be interpreted evil: He that is loyal to his Prince, not only forbears to have his hand in Treaſon, but he takes heed of that which hath a ſhew of Treaſon. A gracious heart is ſhy of that which looks like ſin: When <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtriſs took hold of him, and ſaid, <hi>Lie with me,</hi> he left his garment in her hand, and <hi>fled from her,</hi> Gen. 39.12. He avoided the appearance of evil, he would not be ſeen in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now a pure heart avoids whatever may have the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of himſelf,</hi> and that two ways. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the appearance of evil is oftentimes <hi>an occaſion of evil.</hi> Effeminate Daliance is an appearance of evil, and many times occaſions evil. Had <hi>Joſeph</hi> been famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with his Miſtriſs in a wanton, ſporting manner, he might in time have been drawn to commit folly with her. Some out of Novelty and Curioſity have gone to hear Maſs, and afterwards have lent the Idol not only their <hi>ear,</hi> but their <hi>knee.</hi> In our times are there not many who have gone with <hi>itching ears</hi> into Sectarian company, and have

come home with the <hi>plague in their head?</hi> When <hi>Dinah</hi> would be gadding, ſhe loſt her chaſtity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.2. A pure heart fore-ſeeing the danger, avoids the appearance of evil: 'Tis dangerous to go near an Hornets Neſt. The men who went near the Furnace were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.22. 2. Becauſe the appearance of evil may eclipſe his good name.

It commends us to God and Angels, which riches cannot do<note n="*" place="margin">Opera ſalutis ſine fama boni odoris non ſatis praelucent. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
                     </note>. Now a godly man avoids the appearance of evil, leſt he wound his good name; what comfort can there be of life, when the name lies buried?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A pure heart avoids the ſuſpition of ſin out of reverence and reſpect to the holineſs of God. God hates the <hi>very appearance</hi> of evil: God abhors hypocrites, becauſe they have no more than the appearance of good; and he is angry with his children, becauſe they have ſo much as the appearance of evil. A gracious heart knows God is a jealous God, and cannot endure that his people ſhould border upon ſin, therefore he keeps aloof off, and will not come near the ſmell of infection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A pure heart avoids the ſhew of ſin in regard of the <hi>godly.</hi> The appearance of evil may ſcandalize a weak brother: A gracious heart is not only fearful left he ſhould defile his own conſcience, but leſt he ſhould offend his brothers conſcience; were it only in a <hi>thing indifferent,</hi> yet if it be <hi>an appearance of evil,</hi> and may grieve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are to forbear<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.25, 28.</note>. For <hi>when we ſin againſt the Brethren, and wound their weak conſcience, we ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.12. The weak Chriſtian is a member of Chriſt, therefore the ſinning againſt a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is a ſinning againſt Chriſt.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. A pure heart performs holy duties in an holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This holy manner, or <hi>due order,</hi> conſiſts in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Preparing the heart before a duty:</hi> An unholy heart cares not how it ruſheth upon an Ordinance, it comes without preparation, and goes away without profit: The <hi>pure heart</hi> is a <hi>prepared heart;</hi> it dreſſeth it ſelf before it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168897:129"/>
comes to a Duty, by Examination and Ejaculation: When the Earth is prepared, then it is fit to receive the ſeed; when the Inſtrument is prepared and tuned, it is fit for Muſick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Watching the heart in a Duty:</hi> An holy heart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be affected and wrought upon, his heart <hi>burns within him.</hi> There was no Sacrifice without fire; a pure Saint labours to have his heart broken in a duty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. The <hi>incenſe</hi> when it was broken, did caſt the ſweeteſt favour. Impure ſouls care not in what a dead perfunctory manner they ſerve God. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. They pray more out of <hi>faſhion,</hi> than out of <hi>faith.</hi> They are no more affected with an Ordinance, than the Tombs of the Church. God complains of offering up <hi>the blind,</hi> Mal. 1.8. And is it not as bad to offer up <hi>the dead?</hi> O Chriſtian, ſay to thy ſelf, How can this deadneſs of heart ſtand with pureneſs of heart? Do not dead things pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Outward reverence:</hi> Purity of heart will expreſs it ſelf by the reverend geſture of the body, the lifting up of the eye and hand, the uncovering the head, the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour did bear great reverence to the Word. When God gave the Law, <hi>the Mount was on fire, and trembled,</hi> Exod. 19.18. The reaſon was, that the people might proſtrate themſelves more reverently before the Lord. The Ark wherein the Law was put, was carried upon bars, that the Levites might not touch it: <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.11, 14. To ſhew what reverence God would have about holy things. Sitting in prayer (unleſs in caſe of weakneſs) and having the Hat half on in prayer, is a very undecent, irreverent practice; let ſuch as are guilty reform it. We muſt not only offer up our <hi>ſouls,</hi> but our <hi>bodies,</hi> Rom. 12.1. The Lord takes notice what poſture and geſture we uſe in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168897:130"/>
If a man were to deliver a Petition to the King, would he deliver it with his Hat half on? The careleſs ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence of ſome would make us think they did not much regard whether God heard them or no. We are run from one extream to another; from ſuperſtition to unmannerlineſs. Let Chriſtians think of the dreadful Majeſty of God who is preſent: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.17. <hi>How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this place? this is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</hi> The bleſſed Angels <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their faces, crying, Holy, holy,</hi> Iſa. 6.1.

A pure heart will have a pure life. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Where there is a good Conſcience, there will be a good Converſation. Some bleſs God they have good hearts, but their lives are evil. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi> If the ſtream be corrupt, we may ſuſpect the ſpring-head to be impure. <hi>Aaron</hi> was called <hi>the Saint of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 106.16. He had not only an holy heart, but there was a golden plate on his fore-head on which was written <hi>holineſs to the Lord.</hi> Purity muſt not only be woven into the heart, but engraven upon the life. Grace is moſt beautiful when it ſhines abroad with its golden beams. The Clock hath not only its motion within, but the finger moves without upon the Dyal: Pureneſs of heart ſhews it ſelf upon the Dyal of the Converſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A pure ſoul <hi>talks of God,</hi> Pſal. 37.30. His heart is ſeen in his tongue; the Latines call the Roof of the mouth <hi>Coelum, Heaven.</hi> He that is pure in heart, his mouth is full of heaven.</p>

Angels work; praiſing God, ſerving God; he lives as Chriſt did upon Earth. Holy duties are the <hi>Jacobs Ladder</hi> by which he is ſtill aſcending to heaven. Purity of heart and life are in Scripture made Twins; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within them:</hi> there is purity of heart; <hi>and they ſhall walk in my ſtatutes;</hi> there is purity of life. Shall we account them pure, whoſe Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not <hi>in heaven</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note>, but rather in hell? <hi>Micah</hi> 6.11. <hi>Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</hi> How juſtly may others reproach Religion, when they ſee it kicked down with our unholy feet! a pure heart hath a golden Frontiſpice; grace like new wine will have vent; it can be no more conceal'd than loſt. The Saints are called <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that ſhining luſtre they caſt in the eyes of others.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A pure heart is ſo in love with purity, that nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> can draw him off from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let others reproach purity, he loves it; as <hi>David,</hi> when he danced before the Ark, and <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoffed; <hi>if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this he to be vile, I will yet be more vile,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.22. So ſaith a pure heart, If to follow after holineſs be to be vile, I will yet be more vile. Let water be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the fire, it burns the more: The more others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride holineſs, the more doth a gracious ſoul burn in love and zeal to it. If a man had an inheritance befallen him, would he be laughed out of it? what is a Chriſtian the worſe for anothers reproach? 'tis not a blind mans diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging a Diamond, that makes it ſparkle the leſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let others perſecute holineſs, a pure heart will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it. Holineſs is the Queen every gracious ſoul is eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to, and he will rather dye than be divorced. <hi>Paul</hi> would be holy, though <hi>bonds and perſecutions did abide him,</hi> Acts 20.23. The way of Religion is oft thorny
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168897:131"/>
and bloody; but a gracious heart prefers inward purity before outward peace. I have heard of one who having a Jewel he much prized, the King ſent for his Jewel; Tell the King (ſaith he) I honour his Majeſty, but I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe my life, than part with my Jewel. He who is enriched with the Jewel of holineſs, will rather dye than part with this Jewel: When his honour and riches will do him no good, his holineſs will ſtand him inſtead. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of our ſelves:</hi> Till the heart be pure, all our holy things are polluted; they are <hi>ſplendida peccata:</hi> Titus 1.15. <hi>To the unclean all things are unclean;</hi> their offering is unclean. Under the Law, if a man who was <hi>unclean by a dead body,</hi> did carry a piece of <hi>holy fleſh in his skirt,</hi> the holy fleſh could not cleanſe him, but he polluted that: <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.12, 13. He who had the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, whatever he touched was unclean; if he had touched the Altar or Sacrifice, the Altar had not cleanſed him, but he had defiled the Altar; A foul hand defiles the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt water; an impure heart defiles Prayers, Sacraments;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168897:131"/>
he drops poyſon upon all. A pure ſtream running through muddy ground is polluted; the holieſt Ordinances are ſtained running through an impure heart. A ſinners works are called <hi>opera mortua, dead works,</hi> Hebr. 6.1. And thoſe works which are dead, cannot pleaſe God; a dead wife cannot pleaſe her husband.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Heart-purity is neceſſary in reſpect of God: God is holy; purity is the chief Robe wherewith God himſelf is cloathed. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil:</hi> And will this holy God endure to have an impure heart come near him? will a man lay a Viper in his boſome? the holy God and the ſinner cannot dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. None can dwell together but friends; but there is no friendſhip between God and the ſinner, both of them being of a contrary judgment and diſpoſition. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure heart is more odious to God than a Serpent; God gave the Serpent its venome, but Satan fills the heart with ſin. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>Why hath Satan fill'd thy heart?</hi> The Lord abhors a ſinner, he will not come near him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his plague-ſoars running. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.8. <hi>My ſoul loathed them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heart-purity is neceſſary in regard of the Angels; they are pure creatures: The <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which typified the Angels, were made <hi>of fine gold,</hi> to denote the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Eſſence; no unholy thought enters into the Angels; therefore there muſt be purity of heart, that there may be ſome reſemblance between us and them. What ſhould unholy hearts do among thoſe pure angelical ſpirits?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In regard of the Saints glorified. They are pure, being refined from all lees and dregs of ſin. Their <hi>title</hi> is, <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. Now what ſhould profane ſpirits do among <hi>ſpirits made perfect?</hi> I tell you, if you who wallow in your ſins, could come near
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:168897:132"/>
God and Angels, and ſpirits of men <hi>made perfect,</hi> and have a ſight of their luſtre, you would ſoone wiſh your ſelves out of their company; as a man that is dirty, and in his rags, if he ſhould ſtand before the King and his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſee them gliſtering in their cloth of gold, and ſparkling with their jewels, he would be aſhamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and wiſh himſelf out of their preſence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There muſt be heart-purity in regard of heaven; heaven is a pure place, it is <hi>an inheritance undefiled,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. No unclean beaſts come into the heavenly Ark; there ſhall not enter into it <hi>any thing that defileth,</hi> Rev. 21.27. The Lord will not put the new wine of glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a muſty, impure heart; all which conſidered, ſhows the neceſſity of heart-purity.</p>

Gods will muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fulfilled <hi>by</hi> us, or <hi>upon</hi> us.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Purity of heart is the characteriſtical note of Gods people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> Heart-purity denominates us the <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> It is not profeſſion which makes us the <hi>Iſrael of God;</hi> it makes us <hi>of Iſrael</hi> indeed; but, <hi>all are not Iſrael which are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9.6. Purity of heart is the jewel which is hung only upon the elect. As chaſtity diſtinguiſheth a vertuous woman from an Harlot; ſo the true Saint is diſtinguiſhed from the Hypocrite by his heart-purity. This is like the Noblemans ſtar, or garter, which is a peculiar enſign of honor, differing him from the vulgar; when the bright ſtar of purity ſhineth in a Chriſtians heart,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:168897:132"/>
it doth diſtinguiſh him from a formal profeſſor.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Purity of heart makes us like God; it was <hi>Adams</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> once, he aſpired to be like God in omniſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; but we muſt endeavour to be like God in ſanctity. Gods image conſiſts in holineſſe; thoſe who have not his image and ſuperſcription upon them, he will ſay, <hi>I know you not*.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> God delights in no heart but where he may ſee his own face, and likeneſſe. You cannot ſee your face in a glaſſe when it is duſty: Gods face cannot be ſeen in a duſty impure ſoul; a pure heart (like a clean glaſſe) gives forth ſome <hi>idaea</hi> and repreſentation of God. There is little comfort in being like God in other things beſides purity. Are we like God in that we have a being? So have ſtones. Are we like him in that we have motion? So have ſtars; are we like him in that we have life? ſo have trees and birds; Are we like him in that we have knowledge? ſo have Divels; there is no likeneſſe to God will prove comfortable, and bliſſeful, but our being like him in purity; God loves the pure in heart; lovers founded upon likeneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The excellency of the heart lies in the purity of it. Purity was the glory of the ſoul in innocency; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> purer a thing, is the better; the purer the aire is, and the more free from noxious vapours, the better it is; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of water diſtill'd are moſt precious; the purer the gold is, the more valuable; the purer the wine is when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the lees and dregs, the more excellent it is; the more the ſoul is clarified by grace, and taken off from the lees and dregs of ſin, the more precious account God makes of it; the purer the heart is, the more ſpiritual it is; and the more ſpiritual, the more fit to entertain him who is a Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God is good to the pure in heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> We

                  <p>NOW concerning this bleſſed ſight of God, it is ſo ſublime and ſweet, that I can but draw a dark ſhadow of it; we ſhall better underſtand it when we come to heaven; only at preſent I ſhall lay down theſe nine Aphoriſms or Maxims.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our ſight of God in heaven ſhall be a <hi>tranſparent</hi> ſight; here we ſee him <hi>per aenigma, through a glaſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. But through Chriſt we ſhall behold God in a very illuſtrious manner; God will ſo far unvail himſelf, and ſhew forth his glory, as the ſoul is capable to receive; if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, yet it is probable he ſhould never have had ſuch a clear ſight of God as the Saints in glory ſhall. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is;</hi> now we ſee him as he <hi>is not;</hi> he is not mutable, not mortal; there we ſhall ſee him <hi>as he is,</hi> in a very tranſparent manner; <hi>then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. that is, <hi>clearly:</hi> Doth not God know us clearly and fully? then ſhall the Saints know him (according to their capacity) as they are known; as their <hi>love</hi> to God, ſo their <hi>ſight</hi> of God ſhall be perfect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſight of God will be a tranſcendent ſight, it will ſurpaſs in glory; ſuch glittering beams ſhall ſparkle
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:168897:137"/>
forth from the Lord Jeſus, as ſhall infinitely amaze and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eys of the beholders. Imagine what a bleſſed ſight it will be to ſee Chriſt wearing the Robe of our humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to ſee that nature ſitting in glory above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. If God be ſo beautiful here in his Ordinances, Word, Prayer, Sacraments; if there be ſuch excellency in him when we ſee him by the eye of faith through the proſpective glaſs of a promiſe, O what will it be when we ſhall ſee him <hi>face to face!</hi> when Chriſt was transfigured on the Mount, he was full of glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2. If his <hi>transfiguration</hi> were ſo glorious, what will his <hi>inauguration</hi> be? what a glorious time will it be, when as it was ſaid of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> we ſhall ſee him in the preſence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>arrayed in Royal apparel, and with a great Crown of gold upon his head,</hi> Eſth. 8.15.<note n="*" place="margin">

There will be glory beyond <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> if the Sun were ten thouſand times brighter than it is, it could not ſo much as ſhadow out this glory; in the heavenly Horizon we ſhall behold beauty in its firſt magnitude and higheſt elevation; there we ſhall <hi>ſee the King in his glory</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 33.17.</note>. All lights are but Eclipſes, compared with that glorious Viſion; <hi>Appelles</hi> penſil would blot, Angels tongues would but diſparage it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſight of God will be a transforming ſight: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall be like him:</hi> The Saints ſhall be changed into glory; as when the light ſprings into a dark Room, the Room may be ſaid to be changed from what it was. The Saints ſhall ſo ſee God, as to be changed into his image. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> Here Gods people are black'd and ſullied with infirmities, but in heaven they ſhall be as the Dove, <hi>covered with ſilver wings;</hi> they ſhall have ſome rayes and beams of Gods glory ſhining in them; as a man that rowles himſelf in the Snow, is of a Snow-like white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as the Chryſtal by having the Sun ſhine on it, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and looks like the Sun; ſo the Saints by beholding the

brightneſs of Gods glory, ſhall have a tincture of that glory upon them; not that they ſhall partake of Gods very <hi>eſſence;</hi> for as the iron in the fire becomes fire, yet remains iron ſtill; ſo the Saints by beholding the luſtre of Gods Majeſty ſhall be glorious creatures, but yet creatures ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This ſight of God will be a <hi>joyful</hi> ſight. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt make me glad with the light of thy countenance.</hi> After a ſharp Winter, how pleaſant will it be to ſee the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> diſplaying himſelf in all his glory!

                  <p n="1">1.

It is with going to Law, as it is with going to War, when the Rights of a Nation are invaded; as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.2, 3. and peace can be purchaſed by no other means than War, here it is lawful to beat the Plough-ſhare into a Sword; ſo when there is no other way of recovering ones right, but by going to Law, a man may commence a ſuit in Law, yet be of a peaceable ſpirit. Going to Law (in this caſe) is not ſo much ſtriving with another, as contending for a mans own; it is not to do another wrong, but to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf right; it is a deſire rather of <hi>equity</hi> than <hi>victory:</hi> I ſay as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>The Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully.</hi>

                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:168897:145"/>1. A peaceable ſpirit ſeems to be agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural frame and conſtitution; man by nature ſeems to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a peaceable creature, fitter to handle the Plough than the Sword; other creatures are naturally arm'd with ſome kind of weapon wherewith they are able to revenge themſelves: The Lyon hath his Paw, the Boar his Tusk, the Bee his Sting; only man hath none of theſe weapons, he comes naked and unarmed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, as if God would have him a peaceable creature.
<q>— Candida pax homines, trux decet ira feras. —</q>
Man hath his Reaſon given him that he ſhould live ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and peaceably.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A peaceable ſpirit is honourable. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.3. <hi>It is an honour for a man to ceaſe from ſtrife.</hi> We think it a brave thing to give way to ſtrife, and let looſe the reins to our paſſions; oh no, <hi>it is an honour to ceaſe from ſtrife:</hi> Noble ſpirits are ſuch lovers of peace, that they need not be bound to the peace; 'tis the bramble that rends and tears whatever is near it; the Cedar and Fig-tree, thoſe more noble Plants, grow pleaſantly and peaceably; peaceableneſs is the Enſign and Ornament of a noble mind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To be of a peaceable ſpirit, is highly prudential. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The wiſdom from above is peaceable.</hi> A wiſe man will not meddle with ſtrife; it is like putting ones finger into an Hornets Neſt; or to uſe <hi>Solomons</hi> ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife is as when one letteth out water.</hi> To ſet out the folly of ſtrife, it is as letting out of water in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When water begins to be let out, rhere is no end of it; ſo there is no end of ſtrife when once begun.</p>

                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:168897:146"/>2. The letting out of water is dangerous: If a man ſhould break down a Bank, and let in an Arme of the Sea, the water might overflow his Fields, and drown him in the Flood: ſo is he that intermeddles with ſtrife; he may miſchief himſelf, and open ſuch a Sluce as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph and ſwallow him up. True wiſdom eſpouſeth peace; a prudent man will keep off from the bryars as much as he can.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To be of a peaceable ſpirit, brings peace along with it; a contentious perſon vexeth himſelf, and eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his own comfort; he is like the Bird that beats it ſelf againſt the Cage, <hi>he troubleth his own fleſh,</hi> Prov. 11.17. He is juſt like one that pares off the ſweet of the Apple, and eats nothing but the Kore: So a quarrelſome man pares off all the comfort of his life, and feeds only upon the bitter Kore of diſquiet, he is a ſelf-tormentor; the wicked are compared to a <hi>troubled ſea,</hi> Iſa. 57.20. And it follows, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Ver. 21. The Septuagint renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is <hi>no joy</hi> to the wicked; froward ſpirits do not <hi>enjoy</hi> what they <hi>poſſeſs;</hi> but peaceableneſs of ſpirit brings the ſweet Muſick of peace along with it, it makes a calm and harmony in the ſoul; therefore the Pſalmiſt ſaith, it is not only <hi>bonum,</hi> but <hi>jucundum;</hi> not only <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>pleaſant</hi> to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A peaceable diſpoſition is a God-like diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God the Father is call'd <hi>the God of peace,</hi> Hebr. 13.20. Mercy and peace are about his Throne, he ſigns the Articles of peace, and ſends the Ambaſſadors of peace to publiſh them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God the Son is call'd <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. His name is <hi>Emmanuel, God with us,</hi> a name of peace; his Office is to be a Mediatour of peace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. He
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168897:146"/>
came into the world with a ſong of peace; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did ſing it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Peace on Earth;</hi> he went out of the world with a Legacy of peace: <hi>John</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. God the Holy Ghoſt is a Spirit of peace, he is <hi>the Comforter;</hi> he ſeals up peace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. This bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Dove brings the Olive-branch of peace in his mouth; Now a peaceable diſpoſition evidenceth ſomething of God in a man, therefore God loves to dwell there. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.2. <hi>In Salem is Gods Tabernacle: Salem</hi> ſignifies peace, God dwells in a peaceable ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſts earneſt prayer was for peace; he prayed that his people <hi>might be one,</hi> John 17.11, 21, 23. that they might be of one mind and heart: And obſerve the Argument Chriſt uſeth in prayer, (it is good to uſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in prayer; they are as the feathers to the Arrow, which make it flie ſwifter, and pierce deeper; Affections in prayer are as the fire in the Gun; Arguments in prayer are as the Bullet) the Argument Chriſt urgeth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>That they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> There was never any diſcord between God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Chriſt; though God parted with Chriſt out of his <hi>boſome,</hi> yet not out of his <hi>heart.</hi> There was ever <hi>dearneſs</hi> and <hi>oneneſs</hi> between them: Now Chriſt prays, that as he and his Father were one, ſo his people might be all one in peace and concord. Did Chriſt pray ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for peace, and ſhall not we endeavour what in us lies to fulfill Chriſts prayer? how do we think Chriſt will hear our prayer, if we croſs his?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Chriſt not only prayed for peace, but bled for it. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Having made peace through the blood of his Croſs: Pacem omnimodam;</hi> he dyed not only to make peace between God and man, but between man and man. Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſs, that he might cement
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168897:147"/>
Chriſtians together with his blood; as he prayed for peace, ſo he payed for peace; Chriſt was himſelf bound to bring us into the <hi>bond of peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Strife and contention hinder the growth of grace: Can good ſeed grow in a ground where there is nothing but thorns and bryars to be ſeen? <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>The thorns choaked the ſeed.</hi> When the heart is as it were ſtuck with thorns, and is ever tearing and rending, can the ſeed of grace ever grow there? Hiſtorians report of the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> that the natural ſoile of it is ſuch, that nothing will grow upon that Earth. A froward heart is like the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> nothing of grace will grow there, till God changeth the ſoile, and makes it peaceable. How can faith grow in an unpeaceable heart? for <hi>faith works by love.</hi> Impoſſible it is that he ſhould bring forth the ſweet fruits of the Spirit, who is <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs;</hi> if a man hath received poyſon into his body, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent food will not nouriſh, till he takes ſome antidote to expel that poyſon. Many come to the Ordinances with ſeeming zeal, but being poyſoned with wrath and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they receive no ſpiritual nouriſhment. Chriſts body myſtical <hi>edifieth it ſelf in love, Eph.</hi> 4.16. There may be praying and hearing, but no ſpiritual concoction, no edifying of the body of Chriſt without love and peace.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Peaceableneſs among Chriſtians is a powerful load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to draw the world to receive Chriſt; not only gifts and miracles, and preaching may perſwade men to embrace the truth of the Goſpel, but peace and unity among the Profeſſors of it: When as there is one God and one faith, ſo there is one heart among Chriſtians; this is as Cummin ſeed, which makes the Doves flock to the windows. The Temple was adorn'd with <hi>goodly ſtones,</hi> Luk. 21.5. This makes Chriſts ſpiritual Temple look beautiful, and the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:168897:147"/>
ſtones of it appear goodly, when they are cemented to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in peace and unity.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Unpeaceableneſs of ſpirit is to make Chriſtians turn Heathens; 'tis the ſin of the Heathens, <gap reason="foreign">

They cannot be pacified, their hearts are like Adamant, no oyle can ſupple them, no fire can melt them; 'tis a Heatheniſh thing to be ſo fierce and violent, as if with <hi>Romulus,</hi> men had ſuck'd the milk of Wolves.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To adde yet more weight to the Exhortation, it is the mind of Chriſt that we ſhould live in peace. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.50. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To conclude, if we will neither be under counſels nor commands, but ſtill feed the peccant humour, nouriſhing in ourſelves a ſpirit of diſſention and unpeaceableneſs, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will never come near us.

the taking it: How fatal inteſtine diviſions have been to this Land? <hi>Cambden</hi> and other learned Writers relate, our diſcerptions and mutinies have been the ſcaling ladder by which the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> have formerly gotten into the Nation.

                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:168897:152"/>
heaven to earth to make peace. 2. Peace and unity is a great means for the corroborating and ſtrengthning the Church of God; the Saints are compared to <hi>living ſtones,</hi> built up for a ſpiritual houſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. You know the ſtones in an Arch or Fabrick do help to preſerve and bear up one another; if the ſtones be looſned, and drop out, all the Fabrick falls in pieces: When the Chriſtians in the primitive Church were <hi>of one heart,</hi> Acts 4.32. what a ſupporting was this? how did they counſel, comfort, build up one another in their holy faith? We ſee while the members of the body are united, ſo long they do admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter help and nouriſhment one to another; but if they be divided and broken off, they are no way uſeful, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy languiſheth; therefore let us endeavour to be peace-makers; the Churches unity tends much to her ſtability.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Peace makes the Church of God on earth in ſome meaſure like the Church which is in heaven; the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi> (repreſenting the Angels) are ſet out with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>looking one upon another,</hi> to ſhew their peace and unity; there are no jarrings or diſcords among the heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; one Angel is not of an opinion differing from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; though they have different orders, they are not of different ſpirits; they are <hi>Seraphims,</hi> therefore <hi>burn,</hi> but not in heat of contention, but love: The Angels ſerve God, not only with <hi>pure hearts,</hi> but <hi>united hearts;</hi> by an harmonious peace we might reſemble the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="2">2. Adoption conſiſts in an immunity and diſoblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all the Laws of the former Family. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10. <hi>Forget alſo thy fathers houſe.</hi> He who is ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted, hath now no more to do with ſin. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. A child of God hath indeed to do with ſin as with an <hi>enemy</hi> to which he gives battel; but not as with a <hi>Lord,</hi> to which he yields obedience. He is <hi>free</hi> from <hi>ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.8. I do not ſay he is free from duty: Was it ever heard that a child ſhould be freed from duty to his parents? this is ſuch a freedom as Rebels take.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Adoption conſiſts in a Legal inveſtiture into the Rights and Royalties of the Family into which the perſon is to be adopted; theſe are chiefly two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Royalty is <hi>a new name.</hi> He who is divinely adopted, aſſumes a new name; before a <hi>ſlave,</hi> now a <hi>ſon;</hi> of a ſinner, a Saint, this is a name of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, better than any title of Prince or Monarch. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcomes I will give a white stone, and in the ſtone a new name written.</hi> The white ſtone ſignifies <hi>remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> the new name ſignifies <hi>adoption;</hi> and the new name is put in the white ſtone, to ſhew that our Adoption is grounded upon our Juſtification; and this new name <hi>is written,</hi> to ſhew that God hath all the names of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren enrolled in the book of life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Royalty is, a giving the party adopted an intereſt in the inheritance. The making one an heir, implies a relation to an inheritance. A man doth not adopt another to a <hi>title,</hi> but an <hi>Eſtate;</hi> ſo God in adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us for his children, gives us a glorious inheritance.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168897:154"/>
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>The inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>ſafe;</hi> God keeps the inheritance for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and keeps them for the inheritance; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. ſo that they cannot be hindered from taking poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no diſinheriting; for the Saints are <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs</hi> with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. Nay, they are <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. The members cannot be diſinherited but the head muſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Before I paſs to the next, here a queſtion may ariſe, How Gods Adopting, and mans Adopting differ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Man adopts <hi>to ſupply a defect,</hi> becauſe he hath no children of his own; but God doth not adopt upon this account; he had a Son of his own, the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> he was his <hi>natural</hi> Son, and the Son of his <hi>love,</hi> teſtified by a voyce from heaven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son:</hi> Never was there any Son ſo like the Father, he was his exact Effigies; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The expreſs image of his perſon;</hi> he was ſuch a Son as was more worth than all the Angels in heaven. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Being made ſo much better than the Angels;</hi> ſo that God adopts, not out of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> but <hi>pity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a man adopts, he adopts but <hi>one heir;</hi> but God adopts many. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.10. <hi>In bringing many ſons to glory.</hi> Oh may a poor trembling Chriſtian ſay, Why ſhould I ever look for this priviledge to be a childe of God! 'tis true, if God did do as a man, if he did only adopt <hi>one ſon,</hi> then thou mighteſt deſpair; but he adopts millions, he brings <hi>many ſons to glory;</hi> indeed this may be the reaſon why a man adopts but one, becauſe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:168897:155"/>
he hath not Eſtate enough for more; if he ſhould adopt many, his Land would not hold out; but God hath Land enough to give to all his children. <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Man when he adopts, doth it <hi>with eaſe;</hi> 'tis but ſealing a Deed, and the thing is done; but when God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts, it puts him to a far greater expence, it ſets his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on work to find out a way to adopt us; it was no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing to reconcile hell and heaven, to make the children of wrath, the children of the promiſe; and when God in his infinite wiſdom had found out a way, it was no eaſie way, it coſt God the death of his natural Son, to make us his adopted ſons. When God was about to conſtitute us ſons and heirs, he could not ſeal the Deed, but by the blood of his own Son; it did not coſt God ſo much to make us <hi>creatures,</hi> as to make us <hi>ſons:</hi> To make us creatures coſt but the ſpeaking of a word; to make us ſons coſt the effuſion of blood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Man when he adopts, doth but ſettle earthly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges upon his heir; but God ſettles heavenly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>Juſtification, Glorification.</hi> Men do but entail their Land upon the perſons they adopt; God doth more; he not only entails his <hi>Land</hi> upon his children, but he entails <hi>Himſelf</hi> upon them. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I will be their God;</hi> not only <hi>heaven</hi> is their portion, but <hi>God</hi> is their portion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods filiating or making of children, is <hi>by the infuſion of grace.</hi> When God makes any his children, he ſtamps his Image upon them; this is more than any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can do; he may adopt another, but he cannot alter his diſpoſition; if he be of a moroſe rugged nature, he cannot alter it; but God in making of children, doth <hi>diſponere ad filiationem,</hi> he doth prepare and ſanctifie them for this priviledge; he changeth their diſpoſition, he files
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:168897:155"/>
off the ruggedneſs of their nature, he makes them not only <hi>ſons,</hi> but <hi>Saints;</hi> they are <hi>of another ſpirit,</hi> Numb. 14.24. They become meek and humble, they are <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4.</p>

                     </gap>, his free-grace: We were Rebels and Traytors, and what could move God to make ſinners <hi>ſons,</hi> but free-grace? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of children, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Free-grace gave the caſting voyce; Adoption is a mercy ſpun out of the bowels of free-grace; it were much for God to take a clod of earth, and make it a Star; but it is more for God to take a piece of clay and ſin, and inſtate it into the glorious priviledge of ſon-ſhip. How will the Saints read over the Lectures of free-grace in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Organical or Inſtrumental cauſe of our ſon-ſhip, is <hi>faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Baptiſm doth not make us children, that is indeed a badge and livery, and gives us right to many external priviledges; but the thing which makes God take cognizance of us for children, is <hi>faith.</hi> Gal. 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Before faith be wrought, we have nothing to do with God; we are (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another ſenſe) <hi>baſtards, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:168897:156"/>
not ſons,</hi> Hebr. 12.7. An unbeliever may call God his <hi>Judge,</hi> but not his <hi>Father.</hi> Wicked men may draw near to God in Ordinances, and hope that God will be their Father; but while they are unbelievers, they are <hi>baſtards;</hi> and God will not Father them, but will lay them at the Divels door: <hi>Ye are the children of God by faith;</hi> faith doth <hi>legitimate</hi> us, it confers upon us the title of ſon-ſhip, and gives us right to inherit.</p>
                  <p>How then ſhould we labour for faith! without faith we are <hi>creatures,</hi> not <hi>children;</hi> without faith we are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illegitimate; this word <hi>illegitimate,</hi> is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A term of <hi>infamy;</hi> ſuch as are illegitimate, are looked upon with diſgrace, we call them baſe-born; Thou who doſt ruffle it in thy ſilks and velvets, but art in the ſtate of nature, thou art illegitimate; God looks upon thee with an eye of ſcorn and contempt; thou art a <hi>vile perſon,</hi> a ſon of the earth, <hi>of the ſeed of the ſerpent;</hi> the Divel can ſhew as good a Coat of Armes as thou.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This word <hi>illegitimate</hi> imports <hi>infelicity</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi> Perſons illegitimate cannot inherit legally; the Land goes only to ſuch as are lawful heirs; till we are the children of God, we have no right to heaven; and there is no way to be children but by faith; <hi>Ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here two things are to be diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What faith is.</item>
                     <item>2. Why faith makes us children.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. What faith is: If faith doth inſtate us into ſon-ſhip, it concerns us to know what faith is. There is a two-fold faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A more lax, <hi>general faith.</hi> When we believe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:168897:156"/>
the truth of all that is revealed in the holy Scriptures, this is not the faith which doth priviledge us in ſonſhip; the Divels believe all the Articles in the Creed: 'Tis not the bare knowledge of a medicine, or believing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign vertue of it, will cure one that is ill. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral faith (ſo much cryed up by ſome) will not ſave; this a man may have, and yet not love God. He may believe that God will come to judge the quick and the dead, and hate him; as the priſoner believeth the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es coming to the Aſſizes, and abhors the thoughts of him. Take heed of reſting in a general faith; you may have this, and be no better than Divels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>ſpecial faith; fides quâ creditur;</hi> when we do not only believe the report we hear of Chriſt, but reſt upon him, embrace him, <hi>taking hold of the horns of this Altar,</hi> reſolving there to abide. In the body there are <hi>venae ſugentes,</hi> ſucking veins, which draw the meat into the ſtomack, and concoct it there: So faith is the <hi>ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veine,</hi> which draws Chriſt into the heart, and applies him there. This is the <hi>filiating faith;</hi> by this we are made the children of God; and wherever this faith is, it is not like phyſick in a dead mans mouth, but is exceeding ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, it obligeth to duty, it <hi>works by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why Faith makes us children? why not as well other graces, <hi>Repentance, Love, &amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe Faith is inſtituted of God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to this work of making us children. Gods <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> gives Faith its value and validity; it is the Kings ſtamp makes the Coyne paſſe currant; if he would put his ſtamp upon braſs or leather, it would go as currant as ſilver. The great God hath authorized, and put the ſtamp of his inſtitution upon <hi>Faith,</hi> and that makes it paſs for currant, and gives it a priviledge above
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:168897:157"/>
all the graces to make us children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. Faith makes us children, as it is the uniting grace; it knits us to Chriſt; the other graces cannot do this; by faith we are one with Chriſt, and ſo we are akin to God; being united to the Natural Son, we become adopted ſons: The Kindred comes in by Faith, God is the Father of Chriſt; Faith makes us Chriſts Brethren<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 2.11.</note>, and ſo God comes to be our Father.</p>

                  <p>Of all others, let Miniſters be impatient when Gods glory is impeached and eclipſed.

                  <p>By this perſons may try their Adoption; it appears plainly that they are not the children of God, who hate thoſe that are <hi>born of God;</hi> they ſoile and black the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wings of Chriſts Doves, by their aſperſive reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; they cannot endure the ſociety of the Saints.

the preſence of their father; where the King is, there is the Court; where the preſence of God is, there is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; God is in a ſpecial manner preſent in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are the Ark of his preſence: Now if we are <hi>children,</hi> we love to be much in holy duties; in the uſe of Ordinances we draw near to God, we come into our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers preſence; in <hi>prayer</hi> we have ſecret conference with God; the ſoul while it is praying, is as it were parlying with God.

In the <hi>Sacrament</hi> God kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his children with the <hi>kiſſes of his lips;</hi> he gives them a ſmile of his face, and a privy-ſeal of his love; oh <hi>it is good to draw near to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28.

Slighters of Ordinances are none of Gods children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they care not to be in his preſence; they love the <hi>Tavern</hi> better than the <hi>Temple.

A child-like heart anſwers to Gods call, as the eccho anſwers to the voyce; it is like the flower that opens and ſhuts with the Sun; ſo it opens to God, and ſhuts to Tentation; this is the Motto of a new-born Saint, <hi>Speak Lord, thy ſervant hears,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.9. When God bids his children pray in their Cloſets, mortifie ſin, ſuffer for his Name, they are ambitious to obey, they will lay down their lives at their Fathers call. Hypocrites court God, and ſpeak him fair, but refuſe to go on his errand; they are not children, but rebels.</p>

There are two Reaſons why a godly parent will endeavour to bring his childe into the heavenly Kindred.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Out <hi>of conſcience:</hi> A good parent ſees the injury he hath done his childe; he hath conveyed the plague of ſin to him, and in conſcience he will endeavour to make ſome recompence: In the old Law, he that had ſmitten and wounded another, was bound to ſee him healed, and pay for his cure. Parents have given their children a wound in their ſouls, and therefore muſt do what in them lies, by admonition, prayers, tears, to ſee the wound healed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Out of a flaming zeal to the honour of God. He who hath taſted Gods love in Adoption, looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as <hi>engaged</hi> to bring God all the glory he can; if he hath a childe, or acquaintance that are ſtrangers to God, he would gladly promote the work of grace in their hearts; it is a glory to Chriſt, when multitudes are born to him.</p>
                  <p>How far are they from being Gods children, who have no care to bring others into the Family of God! Too blame are thoſe Maſters, who mind more their ſervants <hi>work,</hi> than their <hi>ſouls;</hi> too blame are thoſe parents, who are regardleſs of their children; they do not drop in principles of knowledge into them, but ſuffer them to have their head; they will let them lye and ſwear, but not ask bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; read Play-books, but not Scripture.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE next particular to be diſcuſſed, is the love of God in making us children. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God!</hi> God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>power</hi> in making us creatures, but <hi>love</hi> in making us ſons. <hi>Plato</hi> gave God thanks that he had made him a man, and not a beaſt; but what cauſe have they to adore Gods love, who hath made them children? the Apoſtle puts an <hi>ecce</hi> to it, <hi>behold!</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">O aeterna &amp; vera charitas! <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> That we may the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Gods love in making us children, conſider three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We were deformed. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8. <hi>When I paſsed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood, it was the time of love. Mordecai</hi> adopted <hi>Eſther</hi> becauſe ſhe was fair; but we were <hi>in our blood,</hi> and then God adopted us; he did not adopt us when we were cloathed with the Robe of innocency in Paradiſe, when we were hung with the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of holineſs, and were <hi>white</hi> and <hi>ruddy;</hi> but when we were <hi>in our blood,</hi> and had our leprous ſpots upon us; the time of our <hi>loathing,</hi> was the time of Gods <hi>loving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As we did not deſerve to be made children, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did we deſire it. No landed man will force another to become his heir againſt his will; if a King ſhould go to adopt a beggar, and make him heir of the Crown; if the beggar ſhould refuſe the Kings favour, and ſay, I had rather be as I am, I would be a beggar ſtill; the King would take it in high contempt of his favour, and would not adopt him againſt his will. Thus it was with us, we
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:168897:165"/>
had no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or willingneſs to be made children; we would have been begging ſtill, but God out of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy and indulgence, not only offers to make us children, but makes us willing to embrace the offer<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note>: <hi>Behold what manner of love is this!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which is the wonder of love that God ſhould adopt us for his children when we were enemies. If a man would make another heir of his Land, he would adopt one that is near akin to him, no man would adopt an enemy; but that God ſhould make us children when we were <hi>enemies;</hi> that he ſhould make us heirs to the Crown, when we were Traytors to the Crown; oh amazing, aſtoniſhing love! <hi>Behold what manner of love is this!</hi> We were not akin to God, we had by ſin loſt and forfeited our Pedigree; we had done God all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and ſpight we could, defac'd his image, violated his Law, trampled upon his mercies, and when we had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered him, he adopted us: What ſtupendious love was this, ſuch love was never ſhewn to the Angels! when they fell (though they were of a more noble nature, and in probability might have done God more ſervice than we can, yet) God never vouchſafed this priviledge of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them; he did not make them <hi>children,</hi> but <hi>priſoners;</hi> they were heirs only to <hi>the treaſures of wrath</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Let all who are thus nearly related to God, ſtand admiring his love; when they were like <hi>Saul,</hi> breathing forth enmity againſt God; when their hearts ſtood out as Garriſons againſt him, the Lord conquered their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs with kindneſs, and not only pardoned, but adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; 'tis hard to ſay which is greater, the myſtery or the mercy; this is ſuch amazing love, as we ſhall be ſearching into, and adoring to all eternity; the bottom of it cannot be fathomed by any Angel in heaven; Gods love in making us children, is,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Love.</hi> When God ſmiles upon us, it is not much to love him; but when he ſeems <hi>to put us away in anger</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal 27.9.</note>, now to love him, and be as the Lime, the more water is thrown upon it, the hotter it burns, this is love indeed.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:168897:170"/>
That love ſure is <hi>ſtrong as death</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, It is for the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of grace: we are all for comfort; if it might be put to our choice, we would be ever upon <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> looking into <hi>Canaan:</hi> we are loth to be in trials, agonies, deſertions, as if God could not love us except he had us in his armes. 'Tis hard to lie long in the lap of ſpiritual joy, and not fall aſleep. Too much Sun-ſhine cauſeth a drought in our graces; oftentimes when God lets down comfort into the heart, we begin to let down care. As it is with Muſitians, before they have money they will play you many a ſweet leſſon, but as ſoon as you throw them down money they are gone, you hear no more of them. Before joy and aſſurance, O the ſweet muſick of prayer and repentance! but when God throws down the comforts of his Spirit, we either leave off duty, or at leaſt ſlacken the ſtrings of our Viol, and grow remiſſe in it. Thou art taken with the money, but God is taken with the muſick; Grace is better than comfort. <hi>Rachel</hi> is more fair, but <hi>Leah</hi> is more fruitful. Comfort is fair to look on, but grace hath the fruitful womb; now, the only way to exerciſe grace, and make it more vigorous and lively, is ſometimes <hi>to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and have no light,</hi> Iſa. 50.10.

                  <p n="2">2. Ordinances ſhall work for good to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Word preached ſhall do them good; 'tis a <hi>ſavour of life,</hi> 'tis a Lamp to their feet, and a Lavor to their hearts; the Word preached is <hi>Vehiculum ſalutis,</hi> a Chariot of ſalvation; 'tis an ingrafting, and a transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word; it is <hi>verbum cum unctione,</hi> it not only brings a <hi>light</hi> with it, but <hi>eye-ſalve,</hi> anointing their eyes to ſee that light; the preaching of the Word is the <hi>Lattice</hi> where Chriſt looks forth, and ſhews himſelf to his Saints; this golden pipe of the Sanctuary conveys the water of life.

To the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate and profane, the Word is not humbling, but hardning. Jeſus Chriſt the beſt of Preachers, was to ſome a <hi>Rock</hi> of offence; the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſucked death from his ſweet lips; 'tis ſad that the breaſt ſhould kill any; the wicked ſuck poyſon from that breaſt of Ordinances where the children of God ſuck milk, and are nouriſhed unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sacrament works for good to the children of God; in the Word preached the Saints hear Chriſts <hi>voyce,</hi> in the Sacrament they have his <hi>kiſs.</hi> The Lords Supper is to the Saints <hi>a Feaſt of fat things;</hi> it is an healing, and a ſealing Ordinance; in this <hi>Charger,</hi> or rather <hi>Chalice,</hi> a

bleeding Saviour is brought in to revive drooping ſpirits. The Sacrament hath glorious effects in the hearts of Gods children; it quickens their affections, ſtrengthens their faith, mortifies their ſin, revives their hopes, encreaſeth their joy; it gives a prelibation and fore-taſte of heaven.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe this is ſo ſweet a priviledge, and the life of a Chriſtians comfort lies in it, therefore I ſhall clear it by Arguments, that the children of God cannot finally periſh; the entail of hell and damnation is cut off; not but that the beſt of Gods children have that guilt which deſerves hell; but Chriſt is the friend at Court which hath beg'd their pardon; therefore the <hi>vis damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> the damning power of ſin is taken away, which I prove thus.</p>

them, Drink ye wine; but they ſaid, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the ſon of Rechab our father, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us, ſaying, Ye ſhall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your ſons for ever.</hi> Thus when Satan and thy own heart would be tempting thee to a ſin, and ſet <hi>cups of wine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, refuſe to drink; ſay, My heavenly Father hath commanded me not to drink. Hypocrites will obey God in ſome things which are conſiſtent either with their credit or profit, but in other things they deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: Like <hi>Eſau,</hi> who obeyed his Father in bringing him <hi>Veniſon,</hi> becauſe probably he liked the ſport of Hunting, but refuſed to obey him in a buſineſs of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance; namely, in the choice of his wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us carry our ſelves as Gods children in <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <hi>Be ye cloathed with humility,</hi> 'tis a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming garment. Let a childe of God look his face every morning in the glaſs of Gods Word, and ſee his ſinful ſpots; this will make him walk humbly all the day after; God cannot endure to ſee his children grow proud; he ſuffers them to fall into ſin, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> that their Plumes may fall, and they may learn to go on lower ground.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us walk as the children of God in <hi>ſobriety:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>But let us who are</hi> of the day <hi>be ſober:</hi> Gods children muſt not do as others, they muſt be ſober.</p>

                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:168897:180"/>2. The children of God muſt be ſober in their <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> hold nothing but what a ſober man would hold; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, is a ſpiritual intoxication, a kind of phrenſie; if Chriſt were upon the earth again, he might have Patients enow; there are abundance of ſpiritual Lunaticks among us which need heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The children of God muſt be ſober in their <hi>attire.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3. <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, &amp;c. But let it be the hidden man of the heart.</hi> Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt not be conformed to the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. 'tis not for Gods children to do as others, taking up every faſhion. What is a naked breaſt, but a glaſs in which you may ſee a vain heart? What is ſpotting of faces, but learning the black Art? God may turn theſe <hi>black ſpots</hi> into <hi>blew;</hi> walk ſoberly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us carry our ſelves as the children of God in <hi>ſedulity;</hi> we muſt be diligent in our Calling. Religion doth not ſeal Warrants to idleneſs; it was <hi>Hieroms</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his friend, to be alwayes well employed: <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour;</hi> God ſets all his children to work, they muſt not be like the <hi>lillies which toile not, neither do they ſpin;</hi> heaven indeed is a place of <hi>reſt,</hi> Rev. 14.13. <hi>They reſt from their labours;</hi> there the Saints ſhall lay aſide all their working-tools, and take the <hi>Harp</hi> and <hi>Vial;</hi> but while we are here, we muſt labour in a Calling; God will bleſs our <hi>diligence,</hi> not our <hi>lazineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us carry our ſelves as the children of God in <hi>magnanimity</hi> and heroicalneſs. The Saints are <hi>high-born,</hi> they are of the true blood-royal, <hi>born of God,</hi> they muſt do nothing ſneakingly or ſordidly, they muſt not fear the faces of men; as that brave-ſpirited <hi>Nehemiah, Shall ſuch a man as I flie?</hi> Nehem. 6.11. ſo ſhould a childe of

               <p n="6">6. Let us carry our ſelves as Gods children in <hi>ſanctity,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. Holineſs is the diadem of beauty, in this let us imitate our heavenly Father; a debauched childe is a diſgrace to his father; there's nothing doth more caſt a reflection on our heavenly Father, than the irregular act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſuch as profeſs themſelves his children. What will others ſay, Are theſe the children of the moſt High, is God their Father? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>The Name of God is blaſphemed through you Gentiles.</hi> Oh let us do nothing unworthy of our heavenly Father.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

Why do the children of God walk ſo penſively? Are they not <hi>heirs of heaven?</hi> perhaps they may meet with hard uſage in the world, but let them remember they are the ſeed-royal, and are of the Family of God. Suppoſe a man were in a ſtrange Land, and ſhould meet there with unkind uſage, yet he rejoyceth that he is ſon and heir, and hath a great Eſtate in his own Countrey: So ſhould the children of God comfort themſelves with this, though they are now in a ſtrange Countrey, yet they have a title to the <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> above; and though ſin doth at preſent hang about them (for they ſtill have ſome relicks of their diſeaſe) yet ſhortly they ſhall get rid of it; at death they ſhall ſhake off this viper.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, Let us carry our ſelves as the children of God in holy longings and expectations. Children are ſtill longing to be at home; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>We groan ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,

Before <hi>Iſrael</hi> got to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with milk and honey, they muſt go through a Wilderneſs of ſerpents, and a red Sea: So the children of God in their paſſage to the holy Land, muſt meet with fiery Serpents, and a red Sea of perſecution.

                  <p n="2">2. Gods <hi>Deſign;</hi> God hath a twofold deſign in the perſecutions of his children.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Trial;</hi> Dan. 12.10. <hi>Many ſhall be tryed:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is the touch-ſtone of ſincerity; it diſcovers true Saints from hypocrites; unſound hearts pretend fair in proſperity, but in a time of perſecution fall away; <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. Hypocrites cannot ſail in ſtormy weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; they will follow Chriſt to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> but not to Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> like green Timber, they ſhrink in the ſcorching Sun of perſecution; if trouble ariſeth, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites will rather make <hi>Demas</hi> his choice, than <hi>Moſes</hi> his choice; they will prefer thirty pieces of ſilver before <hi>Chriſt;</hi> God will have perſecutions in the world to make a diſcovery of men; ſuffering times are ſifting times: <hi>Job</hi> 23.10. <hi>When I am tried, I ſhall come forth as gold. Job</hi> had a Furnace-faith; a Chriſtian of the right breed (who is born of God) whatever he loſeth, will <hi>hold faſt his integrity,</hi> Job 2.3.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Purity;</hi> God lets his children be in the Furnace, that they may be <hi>partakers of his holineſs,</hi> Hebr. 12.10.

The torrid zone of perſecution made the Spouſes skin black, but her ſoul fair; ſee how differently afflictions work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked and godly; they make the one worſe, the other better.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. That is not to be accounted Martyrdom, when we ſuffer for our offences, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as an evil doer.</hi> Luke 23.41. <hi>We indeed ſuffer juſtly.</hi> I am not of <hi>Cyprians</hi> mind, that the Thief on the Croſs ſuffered as a Martyr; no, he ſuffered as an evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Chriſt indeed took pity on him, and ſaved him; he dyed a <hi>Saint,</hi> but not a <hi>Martyr.</hi> When men ſuffer by the hand of the Magiſtrate for their uncleanneſs, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c. theſe do not ſuffer <hi>perſecution,</hi> but <hi>execution;</hi> they dye not as Martyrs, but Malefactors; they ſuffer evil, for being evil.</p>

That ſuffering will not make men bleſſed, when they ſuffer out of ſiniſter reſpects, to be cried up as the head of a Party, or to keep up a Faction. The Apoſtle implies that a man may give his body to be burned, yet go to hell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Ambitions men may ſacrifice their lives to purchaſe ſame; theſe are the Divels Martyrs.</p>

A ſhip that is to ſail upon the waters, muſt be preſerved from leaking; when Chriſtians are to ſail on the waters of perſecution, let them take heed there be no leak of guilt in their conſcience; he who ſuffers (though it be in Gods own cauſe) with a bad conſcience, ſuffers two hells; an hell of perſecution, and an hell of damnation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould pray for our perſecutors, becauſe they do us good, though againſt their will; they ſhall encreaſe our reward; every reproach ſhall adde to our glory; every injury ſhall ſerve to make our Crown heavier; as <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> ſpeaks in one of his Orations, Every ſtone which was thrown at <hi>Stephen,</hi> was a precious ſtone, which enriched him, and made him ſhine brighter in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.

Self-denial is the higheſt ſign of a thorow-paced Chriſtian; hypocrites may have great knowledge, and make large profeſſion, but it is only the true-hearted Saint that can deny himſelf for Chriſt.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Six manner of wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith unites the ſoul to Chriſt, and that bleſſed head ſends forth ſpirits into the members. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Faith is a grace lives all upon the borrow; as when we want water, we go to the Well and fetch it; when we want gold, we go to the <hi>Mine;</hi> ſo faith goes to Chriſt, and fetcheth his ſtrength into the ſoul, whereby it is enabled both to do and ſuffer; hence it is faith is ſuch a wonder-working grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:168897:199"/>2. Faith works in the heart a contempt of the world; faith gives a true map of the world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.11. Faith ſhews the world in its night-dreſs, having all its jewels pul'd off; faith makes the world appear in an Eclipſe; the believer ſees more Eclipſes than the Aſtronomer; faith ſhews the ſoul better things than the world; it gives a ſight of Chriſt and glory, it gives a proſpect of heaven; as the Mariner in a dark night climbs up to the top of the Maſt, and cries out, <hi>ſtellam video, I ſee a star;</hi> ſo faith climbs up above ſenſe and reaſon into heaven, and ſees Chriſt, that bright morning ſtar; and the ſoul having once viewed his ſuperlative excellencies, becomes cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the world; oh ſaith the Chriſtian, ſhall not I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the loſs of all theſe things, that I may enjoy Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith gets ſtrength from the promiſe; faith lives in a promiſe; take the fiſh out of the water, and it dies; take faith out of a promiſe, and it cannot live; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are breaſts of conſolation; the childe by ſucking the breaſt gets ſtrength; ſo doth faith by ſucking the breaſt of a promiſe. When a Garriſon is beſieged, and is ready almoſt to yield to the enemy, Auxiliary forces are ſent in to relieve it; ſo when faith begins to be weak, and is ready to faint in the day of battel, then the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſter their forces together, and all come in for faiths relief, and now it is able to hold out in the fiery trial.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith gives the ſoul a right notion of ſuffering; faith draws the true picture of ſufferings; what is ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? ſaith faith; it is but the ſuffering of the body, that body which muſt ſhortly by the courſe of nature drop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt. Perſecution can but take away my life; an Ague or Feaver may do as much; now faith giving the ſoul a right notion of ſufferings, and taking (as it were)
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:168897:200"/>
a juſt meaſure of them, enables a Chriſtian to proſtrate his life at the feet of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Faith reconciles providences and promiſes; as it was in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> voyage, providence did ſeem to be againſt him, there was a croſs winde did ariſe, called <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclydon,</hi> Acts 27.14. but God had given him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he would ſave his life, and the lives of all that ſailed with him in the Ship, <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. therefore when the winde blew never ſo contrary, <hi>Paul</hi> believed it would at leaſt blow him to the Haven; ſo when ſenſe ſaith, Here is a croſs providence, ſufferings come, I ſhall be undone; then ſaith faith, <hi>all things ſhall work for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. This providence, though bloody, ſhall fulfill the promiſe; affliction ſhall work for my good, it ſhall heal my corruption, and ſave my ſoul. Thus faith making the winde and tyde go together, the winde of a providence with the tyde of the promiſe, enables a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſuffer perſecution.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Faith picks ſweetneſs out of the Croſs; faith ſhews the ſoul God reconciled, and ſin pardoned; and then how ſweet is every ſuffering? The <hi>Bee</hi> gathers the ſweeteſt honey from the bittereſt herb.
<q>— Saepe tulit laſsis ſuccus amarus opem. —</q>
So faith from the ſharpeſt trials gathers the ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, faith looks upon ſuffering as Gods love token<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afflictions (ſaith <hi>Nazianzene</hi>) are ſharp arrows, but they are ſhot from the hand of a loving Father; faith can taſte honey at the end of the rod; faith fetches joy out of ſuffering, <hi>John</hi> 16.20. Faith gets an honey-comb in the belly of the Lyon, it finds a jewel under the croſs; and thus you ſee how faith comes to be ſuch Armour of proof; <hi>above all taking the ſhield of faith;</hi> a believer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:168897:200"/>
caſt his Anchor in heaven, cannot ſink in the waters of perſecution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suffering grace is <hi>love;</hi> get hearts fired with love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the Lord Jeſus; love is a grace both active and paſſive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Love is <hi>active,</hi> it layes a Law of conſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Christ conſtrains me;</hi> love is the wing of the ſoul that ſets it a flying, and the weight of the ſoul that ſets it a going; love never thinks it can do enough for Chriſt; as he who loves the world, never thinks he can take pains enough for it; love is never weary, it is not tired, unleſs with its own ſlowneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love is <hi>paſsive,</hi> it enables to ſuffer; a man that loves his friend, will ſuffer any thing for him rather than he ſhall be wronged. The <hi>Curtii</hi> laid down their lives for the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe they loved them; love made our dear Lord ſuffer for us; <hi>per vulnera viſcera;</hi> as the Pelican out of her love to her young ones, when they are bitten with Serpents, feeds them with her own blood to recover them again; ſo when we had been bitten by the old Serpent, that Chriſt might recover us, he did feed us with his own blood. <hi>Jacobs</hi> love to <hi>Rachel,</hi> made him almoſt hazard his life for her. <hi>Many waters cannot quench love,</hi> Cant. 8.7. No not the waters of perſecution; <hi>love is ſtrong as death,</hi> Cant. 8.6. Death makes it way through the greateſt oppoſitions; ſo love will make its way to Chriſt through the Priſon and the Furnace. But all pretend love to Chriſt; how ſhall we know that we have ſuch a love to him as will make us ſuffer?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True love is <hi>amor amicitiae, a love of friendſhip,</hi> which is genuine and ingenuous, when we love Chriſt for himſelf; there is a mercenary and meretricious love, when we love divine objects <hi>propter aliud, for ſomething elſe:</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:168897:201"/>
a man may love the Queen of truth for the jewel at her ear, becauſe ſhe brings preferment; a man may love Chriſt for his <hi>head of gold</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 5.11.</note>, becauſe he enricheth with glory; but true love is when we love Chriſt for his <hi>love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> namely, that infinite and ſuperlative beauty which ſhines in him†<note n="*" place="margin">Jeſus propter Jeſum. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                     </note> as a man loves ſweet wine for its ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. True love is <hi>amor deſiderii, a love of deſire,</hi> when we deſire to be united to Chriſt as the fountain of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; love deſires union; the ſoul that loves Chriſt, is, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of death, becauſe this diſſolution tends to union; Death ſlips one knot, and tyes another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True love is <hi>amor benevolentiae, a love of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi> when ſo far as we are able we endeavour to lift up Chriſts name in the world; as the wiſe men brought him <hi>gold and franckincenſe,</hi> Mat. 2.11. ſo we bring him our tribute of ſervice, and are willing that he ſhould riſe, though it be by our fall. In ſhort, that love which is kindled from heaven, makes us give Chriſt the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of our affection. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.2. <hi>I would cauſe thee to drink of ſpiced wine, and the juyce of my Pomgranates.</hi> If the Spouſe hath a cup which is more juycy and ſpiced, Chriſt ſhall drink off that; indeed we can never love Chriſt too much; we may love gold in the exceſs, but not Chriſt; the Angels do not love Chriſt to his worth. Now when love is boyled up to this heighth, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to ſuffer; <hi>love is ſtrong as death;</hi> the Martyrs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> firſt burned in love, and then in fire.</p>

Patience makes a Chriſtian invincible, it is like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that bears all ſtroaks. We cannot be men without
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:168897:201"/>
patience; paſſion doth unman a man, it puts him beſide the uſe of reaſon; we cannot be Martyrs without pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, patience makes us endure, <hi>James</hi> 5.10. We read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. of a beaſt <hi>like unto a Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a Bear, and the Dragon gave him his power, &amp;c.</hi> This Beaſt is to be underſtood of the Antichriſtian power. Antichriſt may be compared to a <hi>Leopard</hi> for ſubtilty and fierceneſs; and on his head was <hi>the name of blaſpheming,</hi> ver. 1. which agrees with that deſcription of the man of ſin. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God;</hi> and the <hi>Dragon gave him power,</hi> Ver. 2. that is the Divel; and <hi>it was given to him to make war with the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13.7. Well, how come the Saints to bear the heat of this fiery trial? <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints;</hi> patience overcomes by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. A Chriſtian without patience, is like a Souldier without arms; faith keeps the heart up from ſinking, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience keeps the heart down from murmuring; patience is not provoked by injuries, it is ſenſible, but not peeviſh; patience looks to the end of ſufferings; this is the Motto;
<q>— Deus dabit his queque finem.</q>
As the Watchman waits for the dawning of the morning, ſo the patient Chriſtian ſuffers and waits, till the day of glory begins to dawn upon him; faith ſaith, <hi>God will come;</hi> and patience ſaith, <hi>I will ſtay his leaſure;</hi> theſe are thoſe ſuffering graces which are a Chriſtians Armour of proof.</p>

A Merchant, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> doth not mind a few ſtorms at Sea, but he thinks of the emolument and gain when the ſhip comes fraught home; ſo a Chriſtian ſhould not be over-ſolicitous about his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſufferings, but think of the rich reward when he ſhall arrive at the heavenly Port. <hi>Great is your reward in heaven</hi>†, Ver. 12.

Alas, what proportion is there between a drop of blood, and a weight of glory? Chriſt himſelf as he was man only (ſetting aſide his Godhead) did not merit by his ſufferings: For 1. Chriſt as he was man, only was a creature; now a creature cannot merit from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. 2. Chriſts ſufferings as he was man only, were finite, therefore could not merit infinite glory; indeed as
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:168897:208"/>
he was God, his ſufferings were meritorious; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him purely as man, they were not. This I urge againſt the Papiſts; if Chriſts ſufferings as he was man only, (though as man, he was above the Angels) could not merit; then what man upon Earth, what Prophet or Martyr is able to merit any thing by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</p>

Chriſts Commandments are like the ballaſt of a ſhip, <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> but not <hi>troubleſome,</hi> all his precepts are ſweet and facil; therefore <hi>called pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and amplifie this, conſider two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why Chriſt layes commands upon his people.</item>
                  <item>2. That theſe commands are not grievous.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Why Chriſt layes commands upon his people, there are two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it is ſutable to his dignity and ſtate; he is Lord Paramount, this name is written on his Thigh and Veſture, <hi>King of Kings,</hi> Rev. 19.16.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:168897:210"/>
And ſhall not a King appoint Laws to his ſubjects? it is one of the <hi>jura regalia,</hi> the flowres of the Crown to enact Laws and Statutes; what is a King without his Laws? And ſhall not Chriſt (<hi>by whom Kings reign</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 8.15.</note>) put forth his Royal Edicts by which the world ſhall be governed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>Saints;</hi> it is well for the people of God that they have Laws to binde and check the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies of their unruly hearts; how far would the Vine ſpread its luxuriant branches were it not pruned, and tyed? the heart would be ready to run wilde in ſin, if it had not affliction to prune it, and the Laws of Chriſt to binde it; the precepts of Chriſt are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a yoke,</hi> Matth. 11.30. The yoke is uſeful, it doth keep the Oxen in from ſtragling and running out; ſo the precepts of Chriſt as a yoke, do keep the godly from ſtragling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin; whether ſhould we not run, into what damnable opinions and practiſes, did not Chriſts Lawes lay a check and reſtraint upon us? <hi>Bleſſed be God for precepts.</hi> That is a bleſſed yoke which yokes our corruptions; we ſhould run to hell were it not for this yoke. The Lawes of Chriſt are a ſpiritual hedge, which keeps the people of God within the <hi>paſtures</hi> of Ordinances; ſome that have broken this hedge, and have ſtragled, are now in the <hi>Divels pound.</hi> Thus we ſee what need the Saints have of the Royal Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing I am to demonſtrate, is, That Chriſts commands are not grievous; I confeſs they are grievous to the unregenerate man, to <hi>mourn for ſin,</hi> to be <hi>pure in heart,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſs ſake, Durus hic ſermo,</hi> this is grievous to fleſh and blood; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſts commands are compared to <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>cords,</hi> Pſal. 2. becauſe carnal men look upon them ſo. Gods commands reſtrain men from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:168897:210"/>
and binde them to their good behaviour, therefore they hate theſe bonds, and inſtead of breaking off ſin, ſay, <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us,</hi> Pſal. 2.3. A carnal man is like an unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Heifer, which will not endure the yoke, but kicks and flings; or like a <hi>wilde Bull in a net,</hi> Iſa. 51.20. Thus to a perſon in the ſtate of nature Chriſts commands are grievous.</p>
               <p>Nay, to a childe of God, ſo far as corruption prevails, (for he is but in part regenerate) Chriſts Laws ſeem irkſome; the fleſh cries out, it cannot pray or ſuffer; <hi>the Law in the members</hi> rebels againſt Chriſts Law; only the ſpiritual part prevails, and makes the fleſh ſtoop to Chriſts injunctions. A regenerate perſon, ſo far as he is regenerate, doth not count Gods Commandments grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, they are not a <hi>burden,</hi> but a <hi>delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine commands are not grievous, if we conſider them firſt <hi>poſitively,</hi> in theſe eight particulars.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian <hi>conſents</hi> to Gods commands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are not grievous <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16. <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> conſent to the Law that it is good.</hi> What is done with conſent, is eaſie; if the Virgin give her conſent, the Match goes on chearfully. A godly man in his judgement approves of Chriſts Laws<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note>, and in his will conſents to them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not grievous; a wicked man is <hi>under a force,</hi> terror of conſcience hales him to duty; he is like a ſlave that is chained to the Gally, he muſt work whether he will or no, he is forced to pull the Rope, tug at the Oare; but a godly man is like a free ſubject, that conſents to his Princes Laws, and obeyes out of choice, as ſeeing the equity and rationality of them. Thus a gracious heart ſees that beauty and equity in the commands of heaven, as draws forth conſent, and this conſent makes them that they are not grievous.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:168897:211"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. They are <hi>Chriſts</hi> comands, therefore not grievous. <hi>Take</hi> my <hi>yoak,</hi> Matth. 11.29. Goſpel commands are not the Laws of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> but a <hi>Saviour.</hi> The husbands commands are not grievous to the wife, it is her ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obey; this is enough to animate and excite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Chriſt commands.</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in another ſence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.28. <hi>Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the water.</hi> So ſaith a gracious ſoul, <hi>Lord;</hi> if it be thou that wouldeſt have me mourn for ſin, and breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heart-purity; if it be thou (dear Saviour) that biddeſt me do theſe things, I will chearfully obey. <hi>Thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> are not grievous. A ſouldier at the word of his General makes a brave onſet.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Chriſtians obey out of a principle of <hi>love,</hi> and then Gods commandments are not grievous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture <hi>ſerving,</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> of God are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.6. <hi>The ſons of the ſtrangers that joyne themſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, and to love the Name of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing is grievous to him that loves; love lightens a burden; it adds wings to obedience; an heart that loves God counts nothing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, but its own dulneſſe and ſlowneſſe of motion; love makes ſin heavie, and Chriſts burden light.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A Chriſtian is carried on <hi>auxilio Spiritus,</hi> by the <hi>help of the Spirit;</hi> and the Spirit makes every duty eaſie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.</hi> The Spirit works in us the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>both to will, and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. When God enables to do what he commands, then, <hi>his commandments are not grievous;</hi> if two carry a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it is eaſie; the Spirit of God helps us to do duties, to bear burdens, it draws as it were in the yoke with us; If the Scrivener guides the childs hand, and helps it to frame its letters; now, it is not hard for the childe to write. If the Loadſtone draw the iron, it is not hard
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:168897:211"/>
for the iron to move: if the Spirit of God as a Divine Loadſtone draw and move the heart, now, it is not hard to obey. When the birds hath wings given it, it can flie. Though the ſoul of it ſelf be unable to do that which is good, yet having two wings given it, (like that woman in the <hi>Revelation</hi>)<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12 24.</note> the wing of faith, and the wing of the Spirit, now it flyes ſwiftly in obedience, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 11.1. <hi>the Spirit did lift me up.</hi> The heart is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly in prayer, when the Spirit lifts it up. The ſails of a Mill cannot move of themſelves, but when the wind blows, then they turn round; when a gale of the Spirit blows upon the ſoul. Now the ſails of the affections move ſwiftly in duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All Chriſts commands are <hi>beneficial,</hi> therefore not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grievous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>And now O Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to love him, to keep his Statutes which I command thee this day for thy good.</hi> Chriſts commands carries meat in the mouth of them, and then ſurely they are not grievous, ſalvation runs along in every precept. To obey Chriſts Laws, is not ſo much of <hi>duty,</hi> as our <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege;</hi> all Chriſts commands centre in bleſſedneſſe. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is in it ſelf very unpleaſant, yet becauſe it tends to health, no man refuſeth it; Divine Precepts are to the fleſhy part irkſome, yet, having ſuch excellent operation as to make us both holy, and happy, they are not to be accounted grievous; the apprentiſe is content to go through hard ſervice, becauſe it makes way for his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; The Scholar willingly wraſtles with the knotty difficulties of Arts and Sciences, becauſe they ſerve both to enoble and advance him.

               <p n="6">6. Chriſt is <hi>bonum ſelectum,</hi> a ſelect choice good; God ſhews more love in giving us Chriſt, than in giving us Crowns and Kingdoms. God may give us other things, and hate us; but in giving Chriſt he beſtows the higheſt pledge of his love; God may give the men of the world <hi>bona ſcabelli,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, the bleſſings of the foot-ſtool; but in giving Chriſt to a man, he gives him <hi>bona Throni,</hi> the bleſſings of the Throne; what though others have a crutch to lean on, if thou haſt a Chriſt to lean on! <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent away the ſons of the Concubines with gifts, but <hi>he gave all he had to Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 25.5. God may ſend away others with a little gold and ſilver; but if he gives thee Chriſt, he gives thee all that ever he hath; for Chriſt <hi>is all, and in all:</hi> Pſal. 145.16. <hi>Thou openeſt thy hand, and ſatisfieſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living thing;</hi> in beſtowing the world, God doth but <hi>open his hand;</hi> but in beſtowing Chriſt, he opens his heart; Chriſt is a crowning bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Chriſt is <hi>bonum fine quo nihil bonum;</hi> he is ſuch a good, as without which nothing is good; without Chriſt health is not good, 'tis fuel for luſt; riches are not good, they are golden ſnares; Ordinances are not good; though they are good in themſelves, yet not good to us, <hi>they profit not;</hi> they are as breaſts without milk, as bottles without wine; nay, they are not only <hi>a dead letter,</hi> but a <hi>ſavour of death;</hi> without Chriſt they will damn us; for want of Chriſt millions go loaded to hell with Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Chriſt is <hi>bonum permanens,</hi> an enduring good; other things are like the Lamp, which while it ſhines it ſpends; <hi>the heavens ſhall wax old like a garment,</hi> Pſal. 102.26. — But Jeſus Chriſt is a permanent good, with

               <p n="9">9. Chriſt is <hi>bonum diffuſum,</hi> a diffuſive, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative good; he is full, not only as a <hi>veſsel,</hi> but as a <hi>ſpring,</hi> he is willing to give himſelf to us; if indeed Chriſt ſhould ſay, he would have nothing to do with us, we are not in his Commiſſion, he is not ſent to ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as we, then we might deſpair; but he is willing that we ſhould have him; he calls, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary;</hi> he would fain have the match made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and him; oh that we were but as willing as Chriſt is!

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. See your need of Chriſt, know that you are undone without him. How obnoxious are you to Gods eye! how odious to his nature! how obnoxious to his juſtice! O ſinner, how near is the Serjeant to arreſt thee! The Furnace of hell is heating for thee, and what wilt thou do without Chriſt? 'tis only the Lord Jeſus can ſtand as a ſcreen to keep off the fire of Gods wrath from burning thee. Tell me then, is there not need of Chriſt? though Chriſt be offered to ſinners, yet he will not have his love abuſed, he will not throw away himſelf upon ſuch as ſee no need of him; ſee thy ſelf wounded, and then Chriſt <hi>that good Samaritan,</hi> will poure in wine and oyle into thy wounds; think often of that Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p n="2">2. Be importunate after Chriſt Lord, give me Chriſt or I die. As <hi>Acſah</hi> ſaid to her father <hi>Caleb,</hi> Joſh. 15.19.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:168897:226"/>
                  <hi>Thou haſt given me a South land, give me alſo ſprings of water.</hi> So ſhould a poor ſoul ſay, Lord, thou haſt given me an eſtate in the world, but this South-land will not quench my thirſt, <hi>give me alſo ſprings of water.</hi> Give me thoſe living ſprings which run in my Saviours blood; Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever wil let him take the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17, 18. Lord, I thirſt after Jeſus Chriſt, nothing but Chriſt will ſatisfie me; I am dead, I am damned without him, oh give me this water of life. When the <hi>blind man</hi> was importunate, <hi>Jeſus ſtood ſtill,</hi> Luke 18.40. and wrought a cure upon him, <hi>verſe</hi> 42. Chriſt cannot deny a praying ſoul. As the tender mother opens the breaſt when the child cries for it: ſo when an humble, thirſty ſinner cries importunately to heaven, God will open the breaſt of free-grace, and ſay, Here, take my Chriſt, be ſatiated with him, let him be to thee <hi>all in all,</hi> both for food and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be content to have Chriſt as Chriſt is offered, <hi>a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> Acts 5.31. Be ſure you do not compound or indent with Chriſt. Some would have Chriſt and their ſins too. Is Chriſt <hi>all,</hi> and will you not part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th <hi>ſomething</hi> for this <hi>all?</hi> Chriſt would have you part with nothing, but what will damn you, if you keep, namely your ſins. Vomit up this poyſon by repentance, and Chriſt will pour in the wine of his blood to chear your heart.</p>
               <p>There are ſome bid fair for Chriſt, they will part with ſome ſins, but keep a reſerve. <hi>Jacob</hi> would let all his ſons go but <hi>Benjamin;</hi> whereas if you leave but one ſin in your heart, it will be as an Egge for Satan to brood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If a man part with many lovers, and retain the love but of one Harlot, he is an Adulterer: ſo if thou parteſt with many ſins, and doſt retain the love but of one ſin,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:168897:226"/>
thou haſt an adulterous heart, and Chriſt will not make up a match with thee. Doth that man think he ſhall have Chriſts love that feeds ſinne in a corner? O part with <hi>all</hi> for him who is <hi>all.</hi> Part with thy luſts, nay thy life if Chriſt calls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It exhorts us not only to get Chriſt, but to labour <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>3</label> to know that we have Chriſt,<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3. <hi>hereby we know that we know him.</hi> This reflex act of faith is more than the direct act. Some Divines call it <hi>ſenſus fidei,</hi> the perception, or ſenſible feeling of faith; now concerning this knowledge that Chriſt is ours, which is the ſame with aſſurance, I ſhall lay down theſe four Corollaries or concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this knowledge is <hi>feaſible,</hi> it may be had, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> The meaning is, the Apoſtle wrote to theſe believers that they might know they were believers, and might be aſſured Chriſt was theirs. Indeed the Papiſts deny this certainty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it is inſerted in one of their Canons, <hi>Anathema ſit — Let him be Anathema, who holds aſſurance.</hi> But that we may arrive at it, I ſhall evince by theſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why elſe doth God bid us make our calling and election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. if aſſurance may not be had? and to <hi>prove our ſelves whether we are in the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. if we cannot come to this knowledge that Chriſt is ours? The Greek word there for <hi>proving</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies to boar, or pierce thorow a piece of mettal to ſee whether it be gold within or no; a Chriſtian may thus pierce his heart by examination and ſelf-reflection to ſee whether Chriſt be formed within him or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What are all the ſignes which the Scripture gives
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:168897:227"/>
of a man in Chriſt but ſo many ciphers, if the knowledge of this intereſt may not be had? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life becauſe we love the brethren;</hi> and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> Here are two <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, evident characters of a man in Chriſt; now theſe ſigns are in vain if aſſurance may not be arrived at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are ſome duties enjoyned in Scripture, which to perform is utterly impoſſible; if the knowledge of an intereſt in Chriſt be not attainable; we are bid <hi>to rejoyce in God,</hi> Phil. 4.4. and <hi>to rejoyce in tribulation,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. How can he rejoyce in ſuffering, who doth not know whether Chriſt be his or no?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why hath Chriſt promiſed to ſend the <hi>Comforter,</hi> John 14.16. whoſe very work it is to bring the heart to this aſſurance, if aſſurance that Chriſt is ours may not be had? Therefore in Scripture we read of the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The earneſt</hi> and <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. The promiſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter were in vain, the earneſt and witneſs of the Spirit were but phantaſmes and nullities, if the aſſurance of union with Chriſt be not feaſible.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some of the Saints have arrived at this certainty of knowledge; therefore it may be had. <hi>Job knew that his Redeemer lived,</hi> Job 19.25. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had this aſſurance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Yea, may ſome ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> was an eminent believer, a Chriſtian of the firſt magnitude, no wonder if he had this jewel of aſſurance! nay, but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as a caſe incident to other believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? <hi>who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> He doth not ſay, Who ſhall ſeparate <hi>me?</hi> but <hi>us!</hi> ſo that by all it appears that a believer may come to ſpell out his intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:168897:227"/>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Not that the Saints have alwayes the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caution </seg>1</label> fame certainty, or that they have ſuch an aſſurance as excludes all doubtings and conflicts; there will be flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ebbings in their comforts, as well as in their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; was it not ſo in <hi>David?</hi> ſometimes we hear him ſay, <hi>Gods loving-kindneſs was before his eyes,</hi> Pſal. 26.3. As it is a Proverbial ſpeech, <hi>I have ſuch a thing in my eye,</hi> I ſee it juſt before me; but at another time, <hi>Where are thy loving-kindneſses?</hi> Pſal. 89.49. A Chriſtian hath not alwayes the ſame Plerophory; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at one time ſets up the Trophies of victory, and ſings his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or triumphant ſong. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>We are more than Conquerors.</hi> At another time how did the Plumes of his confidence fall? and he was as a man in the midſt of the Sea, ſtrugling with the waves, and crying out for help, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> A Saint in this life is like a ſhip at Anchor, which though ſafe, yet it may be ſometimes toſſed upon the water; theſe doubtings and convulſions God ſuffers in his children ſometimes, that they may long the more for heaven, where they ſhall have a conſtant ſpring-tyde of joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Not that all believers have the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.<label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Aſſurance is rather the fruit of faith, than faith: Now as the root of the Roſe or Tulip may be alive, where the flowre is not viſible; ſo faith may live in the heart, where the flowre of aſſurance doth not appear; yet this is ſure, there is ſo much wrought in the heart of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believer by Gods Spirit as he can bottom his hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as for inſtance, a high prizing of Chriſt, an acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in Chriſt, a rejoycing in his image, a delighting in his word; the weakeſt believer hath ſo much to ſhew as he would not part with for a world.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:168897:228"/>2. Aſſurance is difficult to be obtained; it is a rare jewel, but hard to come by; not many Chriſtians have this jewel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God ſees it good ſometimes to with-draw aſſurance from his people, that they may walk humbly; through the corruption of our nature we are apt to abuſe the richeſt mercies; the Moth breeds in the fineſt cloth, the Worm in the ſweeteſt fruit; pride is apt to breed in this ſweet fruit of aſſurance. It is hard for Chriſtians to want aſſurance, and be content; and to have it, and be humble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan doth what he can to way-lay and obſtruct our aſſurance; he is called <hi>the red Dragon,</hi> Rev. 12.3. And how doth he trouble the waters of a Chriſtians peace? If the Divel cannot keep a believer from heaven, he will do what he can to keep him from an heaven upon earth; he will wrack him with fears and diſquiets. If he cannot blot a Chriſtians evidence, yet ſometimes he caſts ſuch a miſt before his eyes, that he cannot read his evidence; the Divel envies that God ſhould have any glory, or the ſoul any comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we want aſſurance, the fault for the moſt is our own; we <hi>walk careleſly,</hi> neglect our ſpiritual watch, let go our hold of promiſes, comply with temptations; no wonder then if we <hi>walk in darkneſs,</hi> and are at ſuch a loſs, that we cannot tell whether Chriſt be ours or no; our uneven carriage grieves the Spirit, whoſe work it is to ſeal up aſſurance; if we quench the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, no wonder if God quench the comforts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Aſſurance is very ſweet; this wine of Paradiſe chears the heart; how comfortable is Gods ſmile! the Sun is more refreſhing when it ſhines out, then when it is hid in a cloud; for want of this knowledge Chriſt is ours;
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:168897:228"/>
we often hang our Harps upon the Willows, and ſit as <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Rivers weeping, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.1, 2. A man that hath a rich Mine of gold in his Field, yet if he doth not know it is there, he cannot take the comfort of it. One that hath a great Eſtate befallen him beyond the Seas, yet if ignorant of it, he is as if he had no ſuch Eſtate. <hi>Hagar</hi> had a Well of water by her, but her eyes being held that ſhe ſaw not the Well, ſhe ſat weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is the knowledge of an intereſt gives comfort. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.47. <hi>My ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour;</hi> not <hi>a</hi> Saviour, but <hi>my</hi> Saviour. The Rabbins ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> dyed with a kiſs from Gods mouth; he that knows Chriſt is his, hath a kiſs from Chriſts lips, he dyes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing; aſſurance puts a man in heaven before his time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Aſſurance is very uſeful, it will put us upon ſervice for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will put us upon <hi>active</hi> obedience; aſſurance will not (as the Papiſts ſay) breed <hi>ſecurity</hi> in the ſoul, but <hi>agility;</hi> it will make us mount up with wings, as Eagles, in holy duties; faith makes us <hi>living,</hi> aſſurance make us <hi>lively;</hi> if we know that Chriſt is ours, we ſhall never think we can love him enough, or ſerve him enough. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us.</hi> Aſſurance is like wings to the Bird, like oyle to the Lamp, like weights to the Clock, it ſets all the wheels of obedience a going; aſſurance is a whetſtone to the graces, it ſtirs up hope, love, zeal; faith makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>walk,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. aſſurance makes him <hi>run:</hi> Nehem. 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> Aſſurance breeds ſuch joy in the ſoul, as doth derive and iſſue forth ſtrength for duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aſſurance will put us upon <hi>paſsive</hi> obedience: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 5. <hi>We glory in tribulation, becauſe the love
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:168897:229"/>
of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts.</hi> He that hath Chriſts love ſhed into his heart, will be willing to ſhed his blood for Chriſt; he who knows Chriſt is his, will come to him with <hi>Peter upon the waters;</hi> he comforts himſelf with this, though he loſe all <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, he ſhall find all <hi>in</hi> Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſpeaks of a woman in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, who when the adverſaries threatned to take her husband from her, ſhe anſwered, <hi>Chriſt is my husband;</hi> when they threatned to take away her children, ſhe anſwered, <hi>Chriſt is better to me than ten ſons;</hi> when they threatned to take away all from her, ſaith ſhe, <hi>Chriſt is mine,</hi> and you cannot take away him from me; that man who is aſſured Chriſt is his, will hazard the loſs of all for him; he knows though he may be a loſer <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, he cannot be a loſer <hi>by</hi> Chriſt; for <hi>Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi> No wonder Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to be bound, and dye for Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. when he knew that Chriſt <hi>loved him, and had given himſelf for him,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Though I will not ſay <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>proud</hi> of his chain, yet he was <hi>glad</hi> of it, he wore it as a chain of pearle.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The ſoul hath an <hi>intrinſecal</hi> worth. Which appears in two things.</p>

                  <item>2. Immortality.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Spirituality.</hi> The ſoul is a ſpiritual ſubſtance. 'Tis a ſaying among the Ancients, our ſouls are tempered in the ſame mortar with the heavenly ſpirits<note n="*" place="margin">In eodem cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere temperatas eſſe animas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtras cum cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtibus.</note>.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſoul is ſpiritual in its <hi>Eſsence.</hi> God breathed it in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. It is a ſparkle lighted by the breath of God. The ſoul may be compared to the ſpirits of the wine, the body to the dregs: the ſpirits are more pure
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:168897:235"/>
refined part of the wine, ſuch is the ſoul; the body is more feculent, the ſoul is the more refined, ſublimated part of man. Miſtake me not, when I ſay the ſoul is ſpiritual, and that it is a beam of God, I do not mean that it is of the ſame ſubſtance with him; as <hi>Servetus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiander,</hi> and others have held; for when it is ſaid God breath'd into man <hi>the breath of life,</hi> they erroneouſly thought that the ſoul being infuſed did convey into man the ſpirit and ſubſtance of God, which opinion is abſurd and ſinful: For if the ſoul ſhould be part of the Divine Eſſence, then it will follow that the Eſſence of God ſhould be ſubject not only to change and paſſion, but which is worſe, <hi>to ſin,</hi> which were blaſphemy to aſſert; ſo that when we ſay the ſoul is ſpiritual, the meaning is, God hath inveſted it with many noble endowments, he hath made it a mirror of beauty, and printed upon it a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing excellency; as the Sun ſhining upon a Chryſtal, conveys its <hi>beauty,</hi> not its <hi>being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoul is ſpiritual in its <hi>object,</hi> it contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates God and heaven; God is the orb and center where the ſoul doth fix; if you could lift up a ſtone into the higheſt Region, though it did break in an hundred pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it would fall to its center. God is the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the ſoul moves to him, as to its reſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. <hi>Return to thy reſt O my ſoul.</hi> He is the Ark to which this Dove flies; nothing but God can fill an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born ſoul; if the earth were turned into a globe of gold, it could not fill the heart, it would ſtill cry, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> The ſoul being ſpiritual, God only can be the adequate object of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoul is ſpiritual in its operation, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, doth not depend upon the body in its working. The ſenſes of ſeeing, hearing, and the reſt of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the body, ceaſe and dye with the body, becauſe
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:168897:236"/>
they are parts of the body, and have their dependance on it; but the ſoul (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) hath a nature diſtinct from the body, it moves and operates of it ſelf though the body be dead, and hath no dependance upon, or coexiſtence with the body. <hi>Thales Mileſius</hi> an ancient Philoſopher defines the ſoul,<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: He calls the ſoul a ſelf-movable, it hath an intrinſecal principle of life and motion, though it be ſeparate from the body. And thus you have ſeen the ſouls ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The preciouſneſs of the ſoul appears in its immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. There are ſome that ſay the ſoul is mortal; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were well for thoſe who do not live like men, if they might dye like beaſts; but as <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> well obſerves, it is impoſſible for any thing of a ſpiritual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded nature, to be ſubject to death and corruption, the ſouls of believers are with Chriſt after death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23 <hi>Oecolampadias</hi> ſaid to his friend who came to viſit him on his death-bed, <hi>Good news, I ſhall be ſhortly with Chriſt my Lord.</hi> And the devout ſoul ſhall be <hi>ever</hi> with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> The Heathens had ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſouls immortality. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith that the Swan was dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſings ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before her death; by which Hieroglyphick they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the joyfulneſs of vertuous men before their death, as ſuppoſing the Elizian delights, which they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes enjoy after this life. And we read it was a cuſtom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when their great men dyed, they cauſed an Eagle to flie aloft in the Ayre, ſignifying hereby that the ſoul was immortal, and did not dye as the body.</p>
               <p>The ſouls immortality may be proved by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That which is not capable of killing, is not capable of dying; but the ſoul is not capable of killing; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:168897:236"/>
Chriſt proves the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, that it is not capable of killing. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</hi> Therefore the ſoul not being capable of killing, is not in a poſſibility of dying; the eſſence of the ſoul is Metaphyſical, it hath a beginning, but no end; it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>a parte poſt.</hi> The ſoul doth not wax old<note n="*" place="margin">Anima non ſeneſcit.</note>, it lives for ever, which can be ſaid of no ſublunary created glory. Worldly things are as full of <hi>mutation</hi> as <hi>motion,</hi> and like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s <hi>Gourd,</hi> have a worme eating at the root.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoul hath an eſtimative worth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet an high value and eſtimate upon the ſoul; he made it, and he bought it, therefore he beſt knows the price of it. He did ſell himſelf to buy the ſoul. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12. <hi>They weighed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver.</hi> Nay, he was content not only to be <hi>ſold,</hi> but to <hi>dye;</hi> this inhanceth the price of the ſoul, it coſt the blood of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi> God muſt dye, that the ſoul may live; the heir of heaven was morgaged, and laid to pawn for the ſoul of man. What could Chriſt give more than himſelf? what in himſelf dearer than his blood? O precious ſoul, that haſt the image of God to beautifie thee, and the blood of God to redeem thee! Chriſt was the Prieſt, his Divine Nature the Altar, his blood the ſacrifice which he did offer up as an atonement for our ſouls. Now reckon what a drop of Chriſts blood is worth, and then tell me what a ſoul is worth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan doth value ſouls, he knows their worth; he ſaith as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Give me <hi>the perſons, and take the goods to thy ſelf.</hi> So ſaith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>Give me the Perſons.</hi> He cares not how rich you

                  </gap>, his warlike ſtratagems, his ſubtile ſnares, but to catch ſouls? Why doth this Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo roar but for his prey? he envies the ſoul its happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he layes the whole train of tentation to blow up the whole Fort-royal of the ſoul. Why doth he lay ſuch ſutable baits? he allures the ambitious man with a Crown, the covetous man with a golden apple; the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine man with beauty; why doth he tempt to <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s <hi>Lap,</hi> but to keep you from <hi>Abrahams boſome?</hi>
                  <q>Latet anguis in herba.</q>
The Divel is angling for the precious ſoul; to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſouls is his pride; he glories in the damnation of ſouls; it is next to victory to dye revenged. If <hi>Sampſon</hi> muſt dye, it is ſome comfort that he ſhall make more dye with him; if Satan that Lyon muſt be kept in his helliſh Den, it is all the heaven he expects, to reach forth his paw, &amp; pull others into the Den with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having ſhewed you the ſouls preciouſneſs; the next thing to be demonſtrated, is, that the ſoul is more precious than a world: 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Socrates</hi> exhorted young men that they ſhould look their faces in a glaſs, and if they ſaw they <label type="milestone">

Chriſtians, God hath given you ſouls that ſparkle with divine beauty; oh do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthy of theſe ſouls, do not abuſe them:
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:168897:239"/>
There are foure ſorts of Perſons that abuſe their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that degrade their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſet the world above their ſouls; <hi>who pant after the duſt of the earth,</hi> Amos 2.7. As if a mans houſe were on fire, and he ſhould take care to preſerve the lumber, but let his childe be burnt in the fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That make their ſouls Lackies to their bodies. The body is but the brutiſh part, the ſoul is the angelical; the ſoul is the Queen-regent, who is adorned with the jewels of knowledge, and ſways the Scepter of liberty; oh what pity is it that this excellent ſoul ſhould be made a vaſſal, and be put to grinde in the Mill, when the body in the mean time ſits in a Chair of State! <hi>Solomon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of an evil under the Sun, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.7. <hi>I have ſeen ſervants upon horſes, and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth.</hi> Is it not an evil under the Sun to ſee the body riding in pomp and triumph, and the ſoul of man that royal and heaven-born thing, as a Lacky walking on foot?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They abuſe their ſouls, that ſell their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The covetous perſon ſells his ſoul for money; as it is ſaid of the Lawyer, he hath <hi>linguam venalem,</hi> a tongue that will be ſold for a Fee; ſo the covetous man hath <hi>animam venalem,</hi> a ſoul that is to be ſet to ſale for money. <hi>Achan</hi> did ſell his ſoul for a wedge of gold. <hi>Judas</hi> did ſell his ſoul for ſilver; <hi>Judas</hi> ſold cheap pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worths; for thirty pieces he did ſell Chriſt, who was more worth than heaven; and his own ſoul, which was more worth than a world! how many have damn'd their ſouls for money? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. It is obſerved that the Eagles quills or feathers mixed with Hens feathers, will in time conſume them; ſuch is the world to the ſoul;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:168897:239"/>
if you mix theſe earthly things with your ſouls, and let them lie too near you, they will in time conſume and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do your ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ambitious perſon ſells his ſoul for honour; as <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth did ſell his ſoul to the Divel for a Popedom; and what is honour but <hi>res imaginaria?</hi> a Torch lighted by the breath of people, with the leaſt puff of cenſure blown out!
<q>Miſerum eſt alienae incumbere famae.</q>
How many ſouls have been blown to hell with the winde of popular applauſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The voluptuous perſon ſells his ſoul for pleaſure. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> drowned himſelf in ſweet water; ſo many drown their ſouls in the ſweet perfumed waters of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Plato</hi> calls pleaſure the bait that catcheth ſouls: <hi>Ea capiuntur ut piſces hamo.</hi> Pleaſure is a ſilken halter, a flattering Divel, it kills with embracing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They abuſe their ſouls that poyſon their ſouls; error is a ſweet poyſon, <hi>Ignatius</hi> calls it the invention of the Divel<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. They abuſe their ſouls, that ſtarve their ſouls; theſe are they that ſay they are above Ordinances; but ſure we ſhall not be above Ordinances, till we are above ſin. The Apoſtle ſaith, that in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are to remember the Lords death, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:168897:240"/>
them, much more do we need ſuch holy Ordinances, who have but an infant-faith; but Satan likes theſe faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes, he would have men faſt from Ordinances; if the body be kept from food, it cannot live long.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>fooliſh loſs</hi> to loſe the ſoul. <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee,</hi> Luk. 12.20. It is a fooliſh loſs to loſe the ſoul, in a three-fold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is a poſſibility of ſaving the ſoul; we have time to work in, we have light to work by, we have the Spirit offering us help. The ſoul is like a ſhip laden with jewels, the Spirit is a gale of winde to blow; if we would but looſen anchor from ſin, we might arrive at the Port of happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a fooliſh loſs, becauſe we loſe the ſoul for things of no value; worldly things are infinitely below the ſoul, they are <hi>non entia.</hi> Prov. 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes on that which is not?</hi> The world is but a bewitchery, theſe things gliſter in our eyes; but at death, we ſhall ſay we have ſet our eyes <hi>on that which is not:</hi> He that thinks to finde happineſs here, is like <hi>Ixion,</hi> that hug'd the cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno;</hi> and like <hi>Apollo,</hi> that embraced the Laurel Tree inſtead of <hi>Daphne.</hi> Now to loſe the ſoul for ſuch poor inconſiderable things, is a fooliſh loſs; 'tis as if one ſhould throw a Diamond at a Pair-tree, he loſeth his Diamond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a fooliſh loſs; for a man to loſe his ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he himſelf hath an hand in it; is it not folly to give ones ſelf poyſon? a ſinner hath his hands embrued in the blood of his own ſoul. <hi>Perditio tua ex te, thy deſtruction
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:168897:240"/>
is of thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſea 13.9. They lay wait for their own blood, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.18. The fooliſh ſinner nouriſheth thoſe luſts that kill his ſoul; the Tree breeds the worm, and the worm eats the Tree; were it not folly for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to open to the enemy that beſiegeth it? the ſinner opens to thoſe luſts which war againſt his ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. this is a fooliſh loſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>fatal loſs</hi> to loſe the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an unparallel'd loſs, becauſe in loſing the ſoul there are ſo many things loſt with it; as a Merchant in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſhip, loſeth many things with it; his money, plate, jewels, ſpices. Thus he that loſeth his ſoul, he loſeth Chriſt, he loſeth the Comforter, he loſeth the Society of Angels, he loſeth Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an irreparable loſs; other loſſes may be made up again; if a man loſe his health, he may recover it again; if he loſe his Eſtate, he may get it up again; but if he loſe his ſoul, this loſs can never be made up again. Are there any more Saviours to dye for the ſoul? as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to her daughters, <hi>Are there yet any more ſons in my womb?</hi> Ruth 1.11. Hath God any more ſons? or will he ſend his Son any more into the world? oh no, if the ſoul be loſt, Chriſts next coming is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o <hi>ſave</hi> it, but to <hi>judge</hi> it. Chriſtian, remember thou haſt but one ſoul, and if that be gone, all is gone. God, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> hath given thee two eyes, if thou loſeſt one, thou haſt another; but thou haſt but one ſoul, and if that periſh, thou art quite undone. The Merchant that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all in one ſhip, if that ſhip be loſt, he is quite broken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The loſs of the ſoul is an eternal loſs; the ſoul once loſt, is loſt for ever; he that loſeth his ſoul, may ſay as that wicked Doctor of <hi>Paris</hi> on his death-bed,

I ſhall loſe many a ſweet bit at the Cuſtom-houſe; pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is like to be my patrimony; nay, in caſe I follow Chriſt I muſt eſpouſe perſecution; he doth not reaſon thus; but having a call, he haſtens away after Chriſt, <hi>He roſe up and followed him;</hi> and that he might give Chriſt a pledge and ſpecimen of his love, he makes him a feaſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>And Levi made him a great feaſt in his own houſe;</hi> a better gueſt he could not invite; Chriſt alwayes came with his coſt; <hi>Levi</hi> feaſted Chriſt with his chear, and Chriſt feaſted him with ſalvation. Well, Chriſt being at this feaſt, the Phariſees begin to murmur, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Why do ye eate and drink with publicans?</hi> The Phariſees, 1. were <hi>offended</hi> at him that he ſhould go in and eate with
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:168897:242"/>
Publicans. The Publicans were counted the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſinners of the deepeſt dye; yet the Phariſees were not ſo much offended at the ſins of the Publicans, as they had a mind to pick a quarrel with Chriſt. He who was <hi>the Horne of ſalvation</hi> to ſome, was a <hi>Rock of offence</hi> to theſe Jews; others did feed on him, theſe did ſtumble at him. 2. They <hi>accuſe</hi> Chriſt: for theſe words carry in them a Charge and Accuſation, <hi>Why do ye eate with Publicans and ſinners?</hi> The Phariſees impeached Chriſt for eating with ſinners; malice will never want matter of accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though the Divels proclaimed Chriſts holineſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.34. <hi>Let us alone, I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.</hi> Yet the Phariſees tax him for a ſinner; ſee what malice will do, it will make a man ſpeak that which the Divel himſelf will not ſpeak. The Divels ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Chriſt, the Phariſees accuſe him. And if Chriſt who was <hi>a Lamb without ſpot,</hi> could not ſcape the worlds cenſures, no wonder if his people are loaded with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and cenſures of the wicked.</p>
               <p>But let us examine the maſter of the Charge they bring againſt Chriſt, and ſee how groundleſſe it was. They indite Chriſt for going in with ſinners.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt did nothing but what was according to his Commiſſion; the Commiſſion he received from his Father, was, that he ſhould come to ſave ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt went in with ſinners, not to joyn with them in their ſins, but to heale them of their ſins; to accuſe Chriſt, was (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) as if the Phyſitian ſhould be accuſed becauſe he goes among them that are ſick of the Plague; This groundleſſe accuſation Chriſt over-hears, and in the text gives theſe envious Phariſees a ſilencing anſwer, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. In what ſence ſin is reſembled to ſickneſſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin may be compared to ſickneſſe for the manner of catching.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sickneſſe is caught often through careleſneſſe;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:168897:243"/>
ſome get cold by leaving off cloaths. So when <hi>Adam</hi> grew careleſſe of Gods command, and left off the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his innocency, he caught a ſickneſſe; he could ſtay no longer in the Garden, but lay bed-rid; his ſinne hath turned the world, which was a Paradiſe, into an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sickneſſe is caught ſometimes through ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and intemperance. Exceſſe produceth ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. When our firſt parents loſt the golden bridle of temperance, and did eate of the <hi>forbidden tree,</hi> they, and all their poſterity ſurfeited on it, and took a ſickneſſe. The Tree of Knowledge had ſickneſſe and death under the leaves; it was fair to the eye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. but poyſon to the taſte; we all grew deſperately ſick by eating of this tree. <hi>Adams</hi> intemperance hath brought us to faſting and weeping; and beſides that diſeaſe at firſt by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, we have added to it by actual perpetration. We have encreaſed our ſickneſſe, therefore ſinners are ſaid <hi>to wax worſe and worſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Sin may be reſembled to ſickneſſe for the nature of it. As, 1. Sickneſſe is of a ſpreading nature, it ſpreads all over the body, it works into every part, the head, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it diſorders the whole body. So ſin doth not reſt in one part, but ſpreads into all the faculties of the ſoul, and members of the body. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>The whole head is ſick, the whole heart is faint; from the ſole of the foot even unto the head there is no ſoundneſſe in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin doth corrupt the underſtanding <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene</hi> calls the underſtanding the lamp of reaſon,<note place="margin">

                  </note> this lamp burns dim, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Having their underſtanding darkned;</hi> Sin hath drawn a vail over the underſtanding, it hath caſt a miſt before our eyes, that we neither know God nor our ſelves; naturally we are only <hi>wiſe to do

A ſtrait ſtick under water ſeems crooked; ſo to a natural underſtanding the ſtrait line of truth ſeemes crooked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The memory is diſeaſed; the memory at firſt was like a golden cabinet in which divine truths were locked up ſafe; but now it is like a Colander or leaking veſſel which lets all that is good run out. The memory is like a Searcer, which ſifts out the flower, but keeps the bran. So the memory lets ſaving truths go, and holds nothing but froth and vanity. Many a man can remember a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when he hath forgot his Creed. Thus the memory is diſeaſed; the memory is like a bad ſtomack that wants the retentive faculty, all the meat comes up again: So the moſt precious truths will not ſtay in the memory, but are gone again.</p>

The Will is diſeaſed; the will is the ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, it is the maſter-wheele; but how irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and excentrick is it! The Will in the Creation was like that golden bridle which <hi>Minerva</hi> was ſaid to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pegaſus</hi> to guide and rule him; it did anſwer to Gods Will; This was the language of the Will in innocency, <hi>I delight to do thy will O God,</hi> Pſal. 40.8. but now it is diſtempered, it is like an <hi>iron ſinew</hi> that refuſeth to yeild and bend to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.4. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>ye will not come to me that you may have life.</hi> Men will rather die than come to their Phyſician.

               <p n="4">4. The Affections are ſick.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Affection of <hi>deſire;</hi> a ſick man deſires that which is hurtful for him, he calls for wine in a Feaver. So the natural man being ſick, he deſires that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial for him; he hath no deſire after Chriſt, he doth not hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe; but he deſires poyſon, he deſires to take his fill of ſin, <hi>he loves death, Prov.</hi> 8.36.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Affection of <hi>grief;</hi> a man grieves for the want of an eſtate, but not for the want of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: he grieves to ſee the Plague or Cancer in his body, but not for the <hi>plague of his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Affection of <hi>joy;</hi> many can rejoyce in a wedge of gold, not in the croſſe of Chriſt. The Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſick and diſtempered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Conſcience is diſeaſed. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>Their minde and conſcience is defiled.</hi> Conſcience is either, 1. <hi>Erroneous,</hi> binding to that which is ſinful, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf I ought to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things contrary to the name of Jeſus.</hi> Conſcience is an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> leading out of the right way. Or, 2. <hi>Dumb,</hi> it will not tell men of ſin; it is a ſilenced Preacher. Or, 3. <hi>Dead, Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. Conſcience is ſtupified and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; the cuſtome of ſinning hath taken away the ſence of ſinning. Thus the ſickneſſe of ſin hath gone over the whole ſoul, like that cloud which over-ſpread the face of the heavens, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.45.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Sickneſſe doth debilitate and weaken the body; a ſick man is unfit to walk; So this ſickneſſe ofſin weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>When we were without ſtrength Chriſt died.</hi> In innocency <hi>Adam</hi> was in ſome ſence like the Angels, he could ſerve God with a winged ſwiftneſſe, and filial chearfulneſſe; but ſin brought ſickneſſe into the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:168897:244"/>
ſoul, and this ſickneſs hath cut the lock where his ſtrength lay; he is now diſarmed of all ability for ſervice; and where grace is wrought, though a Chriſtian be not ſo heart-ſick as before, yet he is very faint. The Saints prayers do but whiſper in Gods eares, and if Chriſt did not pray them over again, God could not hear them; we ſin fervently, but pray faintly; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>I am this day weak, though anointed King;</hi> ſo Chriſtians, though they have the oyle of grace poured upon them, and they are anointed ſpiritual Kings, yet they are weak; ſin hath infeebled them; they take their breath ſhort, and cannot put forth ſuch ſtrong deſires after God as they ought. When we finde our ſelves dead in duty, our holy affections languiſhing, think thus, This is my ſickneſs, ſin hath made me weak; as <hi>Jephtha</hi> ſaid to his daughter, <hi>Judges</hi> 11.35. <hi>Alas my daughter, thou haſt brought me very low;</hi> ſo may the ſoul ſay, Alas my ſin, thou haſt brought me very low, thou haſt brought me almoſt to the gates of death.</p>

Sickneſs doth eclipſe the beauty of the body:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This I ground on that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt correct man, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a Moth.</hi> The Moth conſumes the beauty of the cloth; ſo a fit of ſickneſs conſumes the beauty of the body. Thus ſin is a ſoul-ſickneſs, it hath eclipſed the glory and ſplendor of the ſoul, it hath turned ruddineſs into paleneſs; that beauty of grace which once ſparkled as gold, now it may be ſaid, <hi>How is this gold become dim!</hi>†<note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 4.1.</note> That ſoul which once had an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent brightneſs in it, it was more <hi>ruddy than Rubies,</hi> its <hi>poliſhing was of Saphyr,</hi> the underſtanding be ſpangled with knowledge, the will crowned with liberty, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections like ſo many <hi>Seraphims</hi> burning in love to God, now <hi>the glory is departed.</hi> Sin hath turned beauty into
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:168897:245"/>
deformity; as ſome faces by ſickneſs are ſo disfigured, and look ſo ghaſtly, they can hardly be known: So the ſoul of man is by ſin ſo ſadly Metamorphiz'd, (having loſt the image of God) that it can hardly be known. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs.</hi> Sin hath turned that Sun of beauty which ſhined in the ſoul, into a Cimmerian darkneſs; and where grace is begun to be wrought, yet the ſouls beauty is not quite recovered, but is like the Sun under a cloud.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Sickneſs takes away the taſte; a ſick man doth not taſte that ſweetneſs in his meat; ſo the ſinner by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſoul-ſickneſs, hath loſt his taſte to ſpiritual things. The Word of God is <hi>pabulum animae,</hi> it is bread to ſtrengthen, wine to comfort; but the ſinner taſtes no ſweetneſs in the Word. A childe of God who is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized by grace, taſtes a ſavourineſs in Ordinances, the promiſe drops as an honey-comb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. but a natural man is ſick; and his taſte is gone; ſince the taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>forbidden Tree,</hi> he hath loſt his taſte.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Sickneſs takes away the comfort of life; a ſick perſon hath no joy of any thing; his life is a burden to him. So the ſin-ſick ſoul is void of all true comfort, and his laughter is but the pleaſing dream of a ſick man; he hath no true title to comfort, his ſin is not pardoned, he may be in hell before night for any thing he knows.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. What the diſeaſes of the ſoul are. <hi>Adam</hi> by breaking the <hi>box of original righteouſneſs,</hi> hath filled the ſoul full of diſeaſes; the body is not ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes as the ſoul: I cannot reckon them all up. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors</hi>

name ſome of the worſt of theſe diſeaſes. Pride is the tympany of the ſoul, luſt is the feaver, error the gangrene, unbelief the plague of the heart, hypocriſie the ſcurvy, hardneſs of heart the ſtone, anger the phrenzy, malice the Wolf in the breaſt, covetouſneſs the dropſie, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſloth the green ſickneſs, apoſtaſie the epilepſie; here are eleven ſoul-diſeaſes, and when they come to the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. The third thing to be demonſtrated, is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſin is the worſt ſickneſs. To have a body full of plague ſores is ſad; but to have the ſoul (which is the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part) ſpotted with ſin, and full of the <hi>Tokens,</hi> is far worſe; as appears:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The body may be diſeaſed, and the conſcience quiet. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>The Inhabitant of the Land ſhall not ſay I am ſick.</hi> He ſhould ſcarce feel his ſickneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin was pardoned; but when the ſoul is ſick of any reigning luſt, the conſcience is troubled. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>ult. There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> When <hi>Spira</hi> had abjured his former faith, he was put <hi>IN LITTLE EASE,</hi> his conſcience burned as hell, and no ſpiritual phyſick that <hi>Divines</hi> did apply, could ever allay that inflammation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may have bodily diſeaſes, yet God may love him. <hi>Aſa was diſeaſed in his feet,</hi> 2 Kings 15.23. He had the Gout, yet a Favourite with God. Gods hand may go out againſt a man, yet his heart may be towards him; diſeaſes are the Arrows which God ſhoots; peſtilence is called <hi>Gods Arrow,</hi> Pſal. 91.5. This Arrow (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> ſaith) may be ſhot from the hand of an indulgent father: But ſoul-diſeaſes are ſymptoms of Gods anger; as he is an holy God, he cannot but hate ſin, <hi>he beholds the proud afar off,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:168897:246"/>
138.6. God hates a ſinner for his plague-ſores: <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.8. <hi>My ſoul loathed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sickneſs (at worſt) doth but ſeparate from the ſociety of friends; but this diſeaſe of ſin, if not cured, ſeparates from the ſociety of God and Angels. The Leper was to be ſhut out of the Camp; this leproſie of ſin without the interpoſition of mercy, ſhuts men out of the Camp of heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. This is the miſery of them that dye in their ſins, they are allowed neither friend nor Phyſitian to come at them, they are excluded Gods preſence for ever, in <hi>whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy.</hi>

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:168897:248"/>
and he will love thee.</hi> A wiſe man had rather drink a ſharp potion, than dye of his diſeaſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>4</label> diſeaſe; he that is wiſe, will avoid thoſe things which will increaſe his diſeaſe; if he be feaveriſh, he will avoide wine which would inflame the diſeaſe; if he have the ſtone, he will avoid ſalt meats; he will forbear a diſh he loves, becauſe it is bad for his diſeaſe; why ſhould not men be as wiſe for their ſouls? Thou that haſt a drunken luſt, do not feed it with wine; thou that haſt a malitious luſt, do not feed it with revenge; thou that haſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean luſt, make not <hi>proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 13.14. He that feeds a diſeaſe, feeds an enemy. Some diſeaſes are ſtarved. Starve thy ſins by faſting and humiliation. Either kill thy ſin, or thy ſin will kill thee.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>5</label> then labour to be ſenſible of this diſeaſe. There are few who are ſenſible of their ſoul-ſickneſſe; they think they are well, and ayle nothing; they are <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>need not the Phyſitian.</hi> 'Tis a bad Symptom to hear a ſick dying man ſay he is well. The Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was a ſick Patient, but, ſhe thought ſhe was well. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and have need of nothing.</hi> Come to many a man and feele his pulſe, ask him about the ſtate of his ſoul, he will ſay, he hath a good heart, and doubts not but he ſhall be ſaved. What ſhould be the reaſon that when men are ſo deſperately ſick in their ſouls, and ready to drop into hell, yet they conceit themſelves in a very good condition!</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a ſpiritual cataract upon their eye, they ſee not their ſoars. <hi>Laodicea</hi> thought her ſelf <hi>rich,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was <hi>blind,</hi> Rev. 3.17. The god of the world <hi>blinds mens eyes,</hi> that they can neither ſee their diſeaſe, nor their Phyſitian. Many bleſſe God their eſtate is good,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:168897:249"/>
not from the knowledge of their happineſſe, but from the ignorance of their danger; when <hi>Hamans</hi> face was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he was near execution. Oh pray with <hi>David, Lighten mine eyes that I ſleep not the ſleep of death,</hi> Pſal. 13.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men that are ſick think themſelves well, from the haughtineſſe of their ſpirits. <hi>Alexander</hi> thought himſelf awhile to be the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and no leſſe than a God; what an arrogant creature is man! though he be ſick unto death, he thinks it too much a diſparagement to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a diſeaſe; either he is not ſick, or he can heal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If he be poyſoned, he runs to the herb, (or rather weed) of his own righteouſneſſe to cure him*.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Men that are ſick, conceit themſelves well, through ſelf-love. He that loves another, will not credit any evil report of him. Men are <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Self-deceit,and the deceit of the heart, appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In hiding the diſeaſe; the heart hides ſin as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> did her <hi>fathers images,</hi> Gen. 31.34. <hi>Haſael</hi> did not think that he was ſo ſick as he was; he could not imagine that ſo much wickedneſſe (like a diſeaſe) ſhould lie lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.13. <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> As the Viper hath his teeth hid in his gums, ſo that if one ſhould look into his mouth he would think it an harmleſſe creature. So though there be much corruption in the heart, yet the heart hides it, and draws a vail over that it be not ſeen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The heart holds a falſe Glaſſe before the eye, making a man appear fair, and his eſtate very good. The heart can deceive with counterfeit grace; hence it is men are
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:168897:249"/>
inſenſible of their ſpiritual condition, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well when they are ſick unto death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Men take up a reverend opinion of themſelves, and fancy their ſpiritual eſtate better than it is through miſtake. And this miſtake is double.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They enjoy glorious priviledges; they were born within the ſound of <hi>Aarons</hi> bells, they were baptiz'd with holy water, they have been fed with <hi>Manna</hi> from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore they hope they are in a good condition, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Then ſaid Micah, Now I know the Lord will do me good, ſeeing I have a Levite to my Prieſt.</hi> But alas, this is a miſtake; outward priviledges ſave not. What is any one the better <hi>for</hi> Ordinances, unleſſe he be better <hi>by</hi> Ordinances? A childe may die with the breaſt in its mouth. Many of the Jews periſhed, though Chriſt himſelf were their Preacher.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other miſtake is ſet down by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>They meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves amongſt themſelves, are not wiſe.</hi> Here is a double Error or miſtake.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They meaſure themſelves by themſelves:</hi> That is, they ſee they are not ſo bad as they were, therefore they judge their condition is good. A Dwarf may be taller than he was, yet a dwarf ſtill; the Patient may be leſſe ſick than he was, yet far from well; a man may be better than he was, yet not good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They compare themſelves amongſt themſelves.</hi> They ſee they are not ſo flagitious and profane as others; therefore they think themſelves well, becauſe they are not ſo ſick as others: This is a miſtake; one may as well die of a Conſumption as the Plague. One man may not be ſo far off heaven as another, yet he may not be near heaven. One line may not be ſo crooked as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet not ſtrait. <hi>To the Law, to the Teſtimony;</hi> the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:168897:250"/>
Word of God is the true Standard and meaſure by which we are to judge of the ſtate and temper of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Oh let us take heed of this Rock, the phancying our condition better than it is; let us take heed of a ſpiritual Apoplexy, to be ſick in our ſouls, yet not ſenſible of this ſickneſſe. What do men talk of a <hi>light within them!</hi> the light within them by nature is not ſufficient to ſhew them the diſeaſes of their ſouls; This light tells them they are <hi>whole,</hi> and have no need of a Phyſitian.</p>
               <p>Oh what an infinite mercy is it for a man to be made ſenſible of ſin, and ſeeing himſelf ſick, to cry out with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> Were it not a mercy for a perſon that is diſtracted, to be reſtored to the uſe of his reaſon? ſo for him that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſtempered, and in a lethargy, <hi>to come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and ſee both his wound, and his remedy!

In regard of his <hi>Call;</hi> God the Father called him to practice Phyſick, he anointed him to the work of healing. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel; he hath ſent me to heal the broken-hearted.</hi> Chriſt came into the world as into an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> to heal ſin-ſick ſouls; this, though it were a glorious work, yet Chriſt would not undertake it, till he was commiſſionated by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, he hath ſent me.</hi> Chriſt was anointed and appointed to the work of a Phyſitian; this was for our imitation; we are not to meddle in any matters without a call; that is acting out of our ſphere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt undertook this healing work, becauſe of that need we were in of a Phyſitian. Chriſt came to be our Phyſitian, not becauſe we <hi>deſerved</hi> him, but becauſe we <hi>needed</hi> him; not our <hi>merit,</hi> but our <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> drew Chriſt from heaven; had not he come, we muſt of neceſſity have periſhed, and dyed of our wounds; our diſeaſe was not ordinary; it had ſeized on every part; it made us not only ſick, but dead; and ſuch Receits were requiſite as none but Chriſt could give.</p>

The Word written is a <hi>Myrothecium,</hi> or Repoſitory in which God hath laid up Soveraign oyles and balſomes to recover ſick ſouls; and the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the pouring out of theſe oyles, and applying them to the ſick Patient. <hi>He ſent his Word, and healed them.</hi> We look upon the Word as a weak thing, What is the breath of a man to ſave a ſoul? but <hi>the power of the Lord is preſent to heal,</hi> Luke 5.17. Chriſt makes uſe of his Word as an healing medicine; the Receits which his Miniſters preſcribe, he himſelf applies; he makes his Word convincing, converting, comforting.</p>

If the diſeaſe be the ſtone of the heart, Chriſt uſeth <hi>proper medicines;</hi> ſometimes the terrors of the Law, ſometimes mercies, ſometimes he diſſolves the ſtone in his own blood.

I am?</hi> Now to ſuch as have their hearts broken with a ſenſe of their unworthineſs, and are diſcouraged from coming to Chriſt to heal them, let me ſay theſe five things by way of reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who did Chriſt ſhed his blood for but ſuch as are unworthy? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Chriſt came into the world as into an Hoſpital, among a company of lame, bed-rid ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though we are not <hi>legally</hi> worthy, we may be <hi>evangelically;</hi> it is part of our worthineſs to ſee our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Fear not thou worme Jacob.</hi> Thou mayſt be a worme in thy own eye, yet a Dove in Gods eye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though we are unworthy, yet Chriſt is worthy; we do not deſerve a cure, but Chriſt hath merited mercy for us; he hath ſtore of blood to ſupply our want of tears.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Who was ever yet ſaved, becauſe he was worthy? What man could ever plead this title, Lord Jeſus heal me, becauſe I am worthy. What worthineſs was there in <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion? what worthineſs was there in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom ſeven Divels were caſt? but free-grace did pity and heal them; God doth not find us worthy, but makes us worthy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we will never come to Chriſt to be healed till we are worthy, we muſt never come; and let me tell you, this talking of worthineſs ſavours of pride, we would have ſomething of our own; had we ſuch preparations and ſelf-excellencies, then we think Chriſt would accept of us, and we might come and be healed; this is to ſee our Phyſitian; oh let not the ſenſe of unworthineſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage<note n="*" place="margin">

If a man had a ſtone in a Ring that could heal many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, we ſay the Ring heals, but it is not the Ring, but the ſtone in the Ring that doth the cure; ſo faith ſaves and heals, not by its own vertue, but as it layes hold on Chriſt, and fetcheth down his ſacred influences into the ſoul.</p>

This Veſſel is filled with breath; ſickneſs broacheth it, and death draws it out. Oh haſten thy ſouls cure, death is upon its ſwift march, and if that ſurprizeth you ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no cure to be wrought in the grave. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>There is no work, nor device, nor wiſdom in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi>

So ſay, <hi>I will tell you what God hath done for my ſoul:</hi> He hath cured me of an old diſeaſe, an hard unbelieving heart, a diſeaſe that hath ſent millions to hell. Truly we may chearfully bear any other ſickneſs, if this ſoul-ſickneſs be cured. Lord (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) ſtrike and wound where thou wilt, if ſin be pardoned. Oh <hi>let the high praiſes of God be in your mouth,</hi> Pſal. 149.6. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects thankfulneſs as a tribute; he wonders men bring not their thank-offering. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Were there not ten clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? but where are the nine?</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Take heed of relapſes: Men are afraid of a relapſe after they are cured; beware of ſoul-relapſes. Hath God ſoftned thy heart? take heed of hardning it.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:168897:262"/>
Thy childe hath <hi>the plague of the heart,</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> haſt conveyed the plague to him; weep and faſt for thy child. Haſt thou a wife or husband that (though they do not keep their bed yet) the Lord knows they are ſick, they are under the raging power of ſin? oh let thy bowels yearn over them; lift up a prayer for them; the prayer of faith may ſave a ſick ſoul. Prayer is the beſt phyſick can be uſed in a deſperate caſe; you that have felt the diſeaſe of ſin, and the mercy of your Phyſitian, learn to pity others.</p>

                  </note>; it is called <hi>unctio manens,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The anointing that abides;</hi> colours laid in oyle are durable; thoſe hearts which are laid in oyle, and have <hi>the anointing of God,</hi> hold their colours, and endure for ever: Grace is compared to a <hi>river of the water of life,</hi> John 7.38. This River can never he dried up; for the Spirit of God is the ſpring that ſeeds it: Grace is not like a Leaſe which ſoon expires; ſo the <hi>Pelagians</hi> would make it; to day a believer, to morrow an unbeliever; to day juſtified, to morrow unjuſtified; this would be like a Leaſe ſoon run out; but God ſettles grace on the Saints as an inheritance, and he will ſee that the entail ſhall never be cut off. He who hath true grace, can no more fall away than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which are fixed ſtars in their heavenly orbs.</p>
               <p>The Arguments to prove the perpetuation of grace, are:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods <hi>Election;</hi> this I ground upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate.</hi> Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the grand cauſe of the Saints preſervation; God
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:168897:270"/>
chooſeth as well to ſalvation, as to ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. What ſhall make Gods Election void?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Power</hi> of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>We are kept by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God through faith to ſalvation.</hi> I deny not but grace in it ſelf may periſh, (our grace is no better coyne than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>) but grace in Gods keeping cannot; the Saints graces of themſelves may break as glaſſes, but theſe glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the hand of God ſhall never break.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods <hi>Solemn Engagement;</hi> the Lord hath paſſed it under hand and ſeal; he hath given bond for the Saints perſeverance. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32, 40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, that I will not turn away from them, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> A believers Charter is confirmed under the broad Seal of heaven; and if grace doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to eternity, it is either becauſe God wants power to make good what he hath decreed, or truth to make good what he hath promiſed; either of which to aſſert were blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed High Prieſt, who hath the golden plate on his fore-head, appears in the Court; and as he poured out blood on the Croſs, ſo he poures forth prayers in heaven for the Saints perſeverance. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> And Chriſt is not only a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but a <hi>Son;</hi> therefore likely to prevail; and which puts the matter out of doubt, what Chriſt prays for as he is man, he hath power to give as he is God. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will; Father,</hi> there he prays as man; <hi>I will,</hi> there he gives as God.</p>
               <p>So that grace is an abiding thing; Chriſtians, you may loſe your friends, your eſtates, your lives; but you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe your grace. Thoſe who hold falling away from grace, would make a believer wear <hi>Cains</hi> mark, which was a continual ſhaking and trembling in his fleſh; they would ſpill a Chriſtians cordial, and break a link of the chain of ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:168897:271"/>2. Let us try whether our grace be true! There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <label type="milestone">

Lapidaries have wayes to try their precious ſtones; let us try our grace by a Scripture touchſtone; the painted Chriſtian ſhall have a painted Paradiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The truth of grace is ſeen by a diſplacency, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy againſt ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104. <hi>I hate every falſe way:</hi> Grace ſets it ſelf againſt complexion-ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. and againſt the ſins of the Times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace is known by the growth of it, growth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth life. Dead things grow not; a picture will not grow: An hypocrite, who is but a picture of Religion, doth not grow; a good Chriſtian grows in love to Chriſt, in humility, in good works. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. <hi>He ſhall grow as the lilly, his branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive-tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon.</hi> When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God diſtills as dew upon the ſoul, it makes grace flouriſh, and put forth into maturity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. True grace will make us willing to ſuffer for Chriſt. Grace is like gold, it will abide the <hi>fiery trial,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. — And if upon a ſerious ſcrutiny and trial we find that we have the right jewel, <hi>the grace of God in truth,</hi> Col. 1.6. this will be a death-bed cordial; we may with <hi>Simeon, depart in peace,</hi> being aſſured that though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt death, yet we ſhall overcome it.</p>

He muſt light up this candle of grace in the ſoul; grace is in his gift; it is not an <hi>impropiriation,</hi> but a <hi>donative:</hi> Oh then go to God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, lay thy heart before him; Lord, I want grace; I want an humble, believing heart, and thou art <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> all <hi>my ſprings are in thee.</hi> Oh enrich me with grace, deny me not this before I dye: What is gold in the bag, if I have no oyle in the Lamp?

               <p n="3">3. If you would have grace, engage the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in your behalf; he is like to be rich, who hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtocks going; he is in the way of ſpiritual thriving, who hath ſeveral ſtocks of prayer going for him.

Inward grace is wrought by outward means; the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word is Gods Engine that he uſeth for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; it is called <hi>the rod of his ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 110.2. and <hi>the breath of his lips,</hi> Iſa. 11.4.

If he was ſo fierce when he was chained, what will he do when he hath full power? when he had taken away all <hi>Jobs</hi> Eſtate, ſmitten his body full of ſoars, and thrown the houſe upon his children, yet all this was in the Divels account but <hi>a touch of the finger,</hi> Job 1.11.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. The way of Gods Commandments is a <hi>clean</hi> way, 'tis a way <hi>paved with holineſs,</hi> Iſa. 35.6. Chriſtians may run in this way, and never wet the ſole of their feet; the way of ſin is defiling; ſuch as uſe themſelves to this way, the filth of hell ſticks upon them; in the wayes of ſin there are ſuch deep ſloughs, that men ſink into perdition; but the way of the Chriſtian race is clean; ſuch as run this race, <hi>cleanſe themſelves from all pollution of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1.</p>

                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:168897:287"/>2. A race is laborious; the running of a race is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe; men do <hi>vires exerere,</hi> put forth all the ſtrength of their bodies in running. Thus Chriſtianity is a race for labour, we muſt put forth all our ſtrength in this race. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after God,</hi> Pſal. 63.8. <hi>I reach forward,</hi> Phil. 2.13, 14. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. A race is ſhort; <hi>breve curriculum,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> calls it; the Greek word for a <hi>race,</hi>

A race is but a ſhort ſpace of ground, it is ſoon run: Thus our time being ſhort, our race cannot be long; and this may encourage us in the race of Religion, and keep us from being out of breath; remember it is but a <hi>ſhort race.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>After ye have ſuffered awhile.</hi> So I may ſay, after ye have <hi>run awhile,</hi> you will be at the end of the ſtage; it is but awhile (Chriſtians) and you ſhall have done wreſtling, weeping, praying, and you ſhall reap the fruit of all your prayers; it is but awhile, and you ſhall have done ſuffering, and be among <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> it is but awhile, and you ſhall be at the end of your race. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhould a childe of God rejoyce to think he hath got over a good part of his race, and is almoſt at the end; as Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> Martyr once ſaid, I have but two ſtiles to go over, and then I ſhall be at my Fathers houſe.

age, comfort your ſelves with this, you have but a few ſteps more to take, and then you are at the end of your race.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In a race there is a Crown or Garland given to him that gets the better<note n="*" place="margin">Bravium ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat praemium quod datur ijs qui ex certami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne victores ſunt; <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing to be illuſtrated, is, to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtian race differs from other races.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In other races <hi>one</hi> only is crowned; ſo in the Text, <hi>but one receiveth the prize;</hi> but in the ſpiritual race many win the prize; the Saints ſhall come to heaven from all the quarters of the world, Eaſt and Weſt, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham and Iſaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> Rev. 7.4. <hi>There were ſealed an hundred and forty and four thouſand of all the Tribes of the children of Iſrael; after this I beheld, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this multitude not numerable, are to be underſtood thoſe that belong to the election, and are ſalvable; theſe as Victors are crowned, and ſtand <hi>with Palms in their hands;</hi> ſhould but one receive the prize, there might be room left for deſpair.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:168897:288"/>2. In other races ſome ſtand ſtill and look on, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there are but two run; but here in the heavenly race all muſt run; thoſe that are unfit to run other races, muſt run this, as the <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>blinde,</hi> none are excuſed from this race; all have run from God by ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all muſt run to him by repentance, either <hi>run</hi> or <hi>damn;</hi> either flie to heaven, or fall to hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In other races the <hi>feet</hi> run, but in the Chriſtian race the <hi>heart</hi> runs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run when thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my heart.</hi> In Religion the heart is all; that which the heart doth not, is not done<note n="*" place="margin">Quicquid cor non facit, non fit.</note>; 'tis not the lifting up of the eye or hand towards heaven that forwards the race, it is the out-going of the heart; many a mans tongue runs in Religion, but not his heart; Doſt thou believe with <hi>thy heart?</hi> Rom. 10.9. Doſt thou love God with <hi>thy heart?</hi> Matth. 22.37. This is to run the race of Religion; this rids away ground, and brings a Chriſtian apace to the Gole; when <hi>Davids</hi> heart was enlarged, then he would run.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In other races, he only gets the prize, that runs faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; but it is not ſo in this heavenly race; though others may out-run us, yet if we hold on to the end of the race, we ſhall receive the reward. Some Saints are like <hi>Aſael, light of foot as a Roe,</hi> 2 Sam. 2.18. They run ſwifter in the race of obedience, as <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> out-ran <hi>Cuſhi,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.23. But this is the comfort of weak believers, though they cannot run ſo faſt as others, yet if they hold on to the end of the race without tyring, they are crowned; he that came in at the <hi>eleventh houre,</hi> had his pay as well as he that came in at the <hi>firſt houre,</hi> Matth. 20.9. To ſhew that thoſe who ſet out later, and may be out-run by other Chriſtians, yet perſevering, they are ſaved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In other races men run for a temporal reward; in the Chriſtian race we run for an eternal; others run for a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crown,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.25. Sometimes the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed

               <p n="6">6. In other races the Garland is beſtowed in a way of merit; but in the Chriſtian-race it is beſtowed as a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of free-grace; though we ſhall not obtain the prize <hi>unleſs</hi> we run, yet not <hi>becauſe</hi> we run; how can we merit the recompence of reward?

               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="8">8. One may loſe other races and not be miſerable; but he cannot loſe this race in Religion but he muſt needs be ſo. In other races a man does but loſe his <hi>wager;</hi> but if he falls ſhort of this ſpiritual race, he loſeth his ſoul; how ſeaſonable therefore is that Apoſtolical cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:168897:289"/>The third thing to be inſiſted on, is, Why we muſt run this race of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>There are three Reaſons; 1. Becauſe God hath ſet us this race. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us run the race that is ſet before us.</hi> It is not <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> it is not left to our choice whether we will run or no, God hath <hi>ſet us the race;</hi> Gods commands carry power and Soveraignty in them: If a <hi>General</hi> bids his Army march, they muſt march. There's no diſputing duty at the Word of God; the heavens drop down their dew, the ſtars ſet themſelves in Battalio, the earth thruſts forth a crop, the Sea is bridled in, and dare not go a ſtep farther: If inanimate creatures obey the word of command, much more thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reaſon; when God ſaith Run the race, we muſt run.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's no other way to get to heaven but by running the race; by nature we are far diſtant from the gole, and if we would have heaven we muſt run for it; a man can no more get to heaven that doth not run this race, than one can get to his journeys end, that never ſets a ſtep in the way. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure, for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred to you abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Our time alotted to us is ſhort; <hi>Job</hi> compares our life to a ſwift Poſt: <hi>Job</hi> 9.25. <hi>My dayes are ſwifter than a Poſt.</hi> The Poets painted Time with wings; if Time <hi>flies,</hi> we had need run; the night of death haſtens, and there is no running a race in the night.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The weight of ſin; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run the race.</hi> The Prophet <hi>David</hi> felt this weight; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi> If we do not throw off this weight by repentance, it will ſink us into hell: A man cannot run a race with a burden upon his back; an unclean perſon cannot run the race of holineſs; a proud man cannot run the race of humility; a ſelf-willed man cannot run the race of obedience. O Chriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden thy ſoul of ſin, through off this weight if thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to lay hold on the Crown.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond weight the Spiritual Racer muſt throw off, is the world. This is a golden weight which hath hindred many, and made them loſe their race. So far as the world is a weight, throw it off; I ſay not lay

               <p n="1">1. That the race is eaſie; many a man thinks he can run the race from earth to heaven on his death-bed. O ſinner, thou that ſay'ſt the race is eaſie, art a ſtranger to the Chriſtian race. Thou art <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> till a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principle of grace be infuſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. is it eaſie for a dead man to run a race? to run the way of Gods Commandements is <hi>againſt nature;</hi> and is it eaſie for a man to act contrary to himſelf? is it eaſie for the water to run backward in its own channel? is it eaſie for a man to deny himſelf, to crucifie the fleſh, to behead his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſin? oh take heed of this miſtake, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian race is eaſie. Do you know what Religion muſt coſt you, and what Religion may coſt you?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Now it is a time of abſence from our Husband Chriſt; therefore we are dreſſed in mourning, and <hi>hang our Harps upon the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;</hi> but how doth the Spouſe deſire the marriage day when the Nuptials ſhall be ſolemnized! at that wedding <hi>the water ſhall be turned into wine:</hi> How doth the pious ſoul cry out in an holy pang of deſire, <hi>uſque quo? how long Lord!</hi> why is thy Chariot ſo long a coming? why tarry the wheeles of thy Chariot? it is the Vote of the whole Church; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Object, <hi>that bleſſed hope;</hi> where we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<list>
                     <item>1. What hope is.</item>
                     <item>2. What a Chriſtian hopes for.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What hope is. I anſwer: Hope is a Theological grace planted in the heart by the Spirit of God, whereby a Chriſtian is quickned to the expectation of thoſe things which are held forth in the promiſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. <hi>If we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it. Aquinas</hi> deſcibes hope thus; <hi>Spes eſt circa bonum arduum, futurum, &amp; poſſibile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hope is <hi>circa bonum,</hi> it looks at ſome <hi>good,</hi> ſo it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from fear; fear looks at <hi>evil,</hi> hope at <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hope <hi>circa bonum futurum,</hi> it looks at ſome good <hi>to come;</hi> ſo it differs from joy; joy is exerciſed about ſomething <hi>preſent,</hi> hope about ſomething <hi>future.</hi> So <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> defines hope, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hope is <hi>circa bonum arduum,</hi> it looks at ſome good which is <hi>difficult to attain.</hi> So hope differs from deſire; deſire is weak and tranſient, it is ſoon over; hope is reſolute and fixed, it wraſtles with difficulties, and will not give over, till it hath the thing hoped for.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hope is <hi>circa bonum poſſibile,</hi> it looks at ſome good which is feaſible, and which there is poſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So hope differs from deſpair; deſpair looks on things with black ſpectacles, and gives all for loſt; hope is like Cork to the Net, which keeps the heart from
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:168897:296"/>
ſinking in deſpair. Thus you have ſeen what hope is.</p>
               <p>Here a Queſtion may be moved, how hope differs from Faith?</p>
               <p>Anſwer; Theſe two graces, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are ſo like, that they have been taken one for the other; there is ſuch a near affinity between them that (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) it is hard to find a difference: But though they are placed near together as the two wings of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims on the Mercy-ſeat, yet they are not the ſame. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in ſome things Faith and Hope do agree; <hi>both</hi> feed upon the Promiſe; <hi>both</hi> help to ſupport the ſoul in trouble: Faith and Hope are like two bladdars put under a Chriſtian, which keep him from ſinking in the waters of affliction; both of theſe graces like cordial-water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the fainting ſoul: There is <hi>joy in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>Rejoycing in hope,</hi> Rom. 5.2. Faith and Hope like thoſe two golden Pipes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.12. empty their golden Oyle of joy into a Chriſtian; but though in ſome things theſe two graces agree, and are alike, yet in ſome things they differ.</p>
               <p>Faith and Hope differ, 1. <hi>Ordine,</hi> in order and prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Faith doth precede and go before hope, it is the Mother grace; Faith is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>The ground if things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. The Promiſes are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; they are like the Ark which had Manna laid up in it; but we muſt firſt believe the things contained in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, before we hope for them. Therefore <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith well,<note n="*" place="margin">Spes eſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectatio rerum qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus.</note> Faith lights the Lamp of Hope, as the fire of the Altar lighted the Lamps of the Sanctuary. Thus theſe graces differ in Priority; Hope is the Daughter of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ <hi>Naturâ,</hi> in their nature, and that two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hope only looks forward at things to come; Faith
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:168897:297"/>
looks backward aſwell as forward; it looks at things paſt aſ well as future: Faith believes Chriſts Paſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as well as his coming to glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hope looks at the <hi>excellency</hi> of the promiſe, Faith looks at the <hi>certainty;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fides intue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur verbum rei, ſpes vero rem verbi. <hi>Alſted.</hi>
                  </note> Hope reads over the writing of the promiſe, Faith looks at the ſeal of the promiſe: <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye hath promiſed.</hi> That which Hope looks at is <hi>eternal life;</hi> that which Faith looks at is the infallibility of the promiſe, <hi>God which cannot lye hath promiſed.</hi> In a word, Faith <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,</hi> Hope <hi>waits;</hi> Faith ſhows a Chriſtian the land of promiſe, Hope ſails thither with patience. Thus you ſee how Faith and Hope differ, but theſe Twins muſt not be parted; Faith ſtrengthens Hope, and Hope comforts Faith; as Elm ſupports the Vine, and the Vine loads the Elm with its fruit: Faith is the Cable, and Hope the Anchor, and both theſe help to keep the ſoule ſteady, that it doth not daſh upon Shelves, or ſink in the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. Thus much for the firſt, what hope is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What a Chriſtian hopes for: This is ſet down,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Emphatically, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: That bleſſed hope.</hi> Hope here is put by a Metonymie for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The things hoped for. That bleſſed hope, is the hope of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A Chriſtians hope is not in this life, then he were in the <hi>Forlone-hope;</hi> here is nothing to be hoped for, but viciſcitudes, all the world rings changes; but, <hi>looking for that bleſsed hope.</hi> This is the difference between the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Anchor, and the Believers Anchor: The Seaman caſts his Anchor downwards, the Believer caſts his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor upwards in heaven, <hi>looking for that bleſſed hope.</hi> The Believer is a rich heir, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.17. and he waits till the Crown-royal ſhall be ſet upon his head. According to our Common Law, there are two ſorts of Free-holds:
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:168897:297"/>
There is a Free-hold in <hi>Deed,</hi> and a Free-hold in <hi>Law;</hi> a Free-hold in Deed, is when a man hath made an entrance upon Lands and Tenements, and is actually ſeized of them; but a Free-hold in Law, is when a man hath right to Lands, but hath not yet made actual entrance upon them. Heaven is a Believers Free-hold in <hi>Law,</hi> he hath a right to it, it is promiſed by the Father, it is purchaſed by the Son, it is aſſured him by the Holy Ghoſt; but he hath not the Free-hold in <hi>Deed,</hi> but waits Gods leaſure, and <hi>looks for that bleſsed hope,</hi> till the time comes that he ſhall actually enter upon poſſeſſion of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Object of a Chriſtian hope is ſet down <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically, The glorious appearing of the great God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt.</hi> Where by the way, the Deity and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt is ſtrongly proved from hence againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> well obſerve: The Apoſtle ſhows who this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>: <hi>The glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour.</hi> There is a threefold Epiphany, or appearing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an appearing of Chriſt <hi>to</hi> us; as when he was Incarnate: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>To us a Child is born.</hi> This was a happy appearing when this morning Star appeared, then ſalvation appeared to mankind; when Chriſt took fleſh, he did marry our humane nature to the divine nature. The Virgins womb was the place conſecrated for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that knot: Great is this Myſtery, <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.

                  </hi> Phil. 2.7. This was Chriſts firſt appearing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an appearing of Chriſt <hi>in</hi> us, that is, when he appears in our hearts, which is called <hi>a forming of Chriſt in us,</hi> Gal. 4.19. Chriſt is ſaid to appear in us, when by the operation of his grace he transforms him into his own image: In the Incarnation Chriſt made himſelf like to to us, by Sanctification he makes us like to him, <hi>holy as he is holy,</hi> and this is a comfortable appearing. What are we better for Chriſts appearing in our fleſh, unleſs he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in our hearts? what are we the better for a Chriſt <hi>without us,</hi> unleſs we have a Chriſt <hi>within</hi> us? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an appearing of Chriſt <hi>for</hi> us; and that two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt appears for us as an Advocate: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.24. <hi>He is entred into heaven, there to-appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> 'Tis a Metaphor borrowed from our Law-Courts, where the Atturney pleads for the Client; ſo Chriſt pleads as an Advocate for the Saints. Satan is the <hi>accuſer,</hi> but Chriſt is the <hi>Advocate,</hi> he anſwers all bills of Indictment brought in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he appears, ſaith the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the preſence of God</hi> for us; the High Prieſts under the Law appeared before the Ark and the Mercy-ſeat, which was but a Type of Gods preſence; but Chriſt appears in the very preſence of God for us, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the face of God;</hi> he ſpreads his merits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father, and in the vertue of his bloody ſufferings pleads for mercy: and if Chriſt appear for us in heaven, ſhall not we appear for him upon earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt appears for the Saints as a Judge, and this appearing is meant in the Text, <hi>looking for the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="581" facs="tcp:168897:298"/>Chriſts firſt appearing <hi>in the fleſh</hi> was dark and obſcure, his beauty was vail'd over, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. all that ſaw the <hi>Man,</hi> did not ſee the <hi>Meſiah.</hi> But his ſecond appearing as our <hi>Judge</hi> will be a glorious appearing, like the Sun breaking out of a Cloud<note n="*" place="margin">Tunc ejus ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. His attendants ſhall be glorious: <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him.</hi> The Angels are the Courtiers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they are compared to <hi>lightning,</hi> Matth. 28.3. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſparkling luſtre, and theſe glorious ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirits ſhall be <hi>Chriſti ſatellitium,</hi> part of Chriſts Train and Retinue, accompanying him to his Throne; thus it will be a glorious appearing in regard of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be a glorious appearing in regard of the Saints. Chriſt will appear to do three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt as a Judge will appear to acquit his people, and that is by pronouncing the ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> The debt-book ſhall be croſſed in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt as a Judge will appear to vindicate his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The names of the godly many times lie buried in reproach; but at that day; they ſhall (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith)

                  <hi>Fragrare unguentis optimis,</hi> Chriſt will give them <hi>a new name;</hi> he will call them his friends, his Spouſe, the apple of his eye, their names ſhall flouriſh with honour, and give forth their perfume <hi>as the wine of Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt as a Judge will appear to crown his people, when body and ſoul ſhall be reunited and perfected in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

man to a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> Job 8.14. And the ſinners hope is fitly reſembled to a Spiders Web three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spiders Web hath no foundation; ſuch is the hope of the wicked; it is a pleaſing thing, but it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reſt upon: A godly mans hope is built upon a double Baſis.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Word</hi> of God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5. <hi>In his word do I hope.</hi> The Word ſaith, <hi>Let the ſinner forſake his way;</hi> and the Lord will <hi>abundantly pardon:</hi> The Word ſaith, <hi>Hereby we know that Chriſt abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. Now a child of God finding theſe qualifications wrought in him, he builds his hope for heaven upon them; <hi>In his Word do I hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The hope of a godly man is built upon <hi>experiences:</hi> Rom. 5.4. <hi>Experience worketh hope.</hi> A Believer can bring in a Catalogue of experiences; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.65. <hi>Thou haſt dealt well with thy ſervant.</hi> So can a Believer ſay, God hath dealt well with him: In ſeveral caſes he hath had experiences of God; when his ſins and tentations have been ſtrong, God hath come in with Auxiliary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>and his grace hath been ſufficient.</hi> When his heart hath been ſinking under fears, God hath boyed him up out of quickſands, and lifted up his head out of deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Thou art O Lord my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</hi> When his heart hath been dead in duty, the Spirit of God hath been ſweetly tuning of his ſoul, and now he <hi>makes melody in his heart to the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 5.19. A godly man hath many ſignal experiences of Gods favour to him, <hi>and experience breeds hope:</hi> So that a godly mans hope hath a foundation, it is a well-built hope; that hope muſt needs ſtand ſtrong, which ſtands with one foot upon a promiſe, and with the other foot upon an experience: But a wicked mans hope is <hi>tela aranea,</hi> a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> he hath nothing to ground his hope upon,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:168897:301"/>
his hope is an impoſture, a golden dream; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.8. <hi>It is as when an hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth, but he awaketh and his ſoul is empty.</hi> The hope of a ſinner is like a dying mans will, that hath neither ſeal ſet to it, or witneſſes; in the will he promiſeth to bequeath ſuch a Mannor and Lordſhip, ſo many thouſand pounds to ſuch a one; but the will being without ſeal and witneſſes, it is null and void in Law; juſt ſuch is the hope of a wicked man, his hope promiſeth him great matters, that Chriſt is his, and all the priviledges of heaven are his, but alas it is a meer deluſion of his falſe heart; when things come to be examined, he wants both ſeal and witneſſes; he wants the ſeal of the Word to confirm his Title, and the witneſs of the Spirit, <hi>Plurimi ſpe periclitantur;</hi>

The Helmet keeps off the blow of the ſword, or arrow from entring: So hope as an helmet keeps off the ſtroke from a Chriſtian that it ſhall not hurt or diſmay him. In time of publick calamities, hope keeps the ſoul from ſinking; <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Lord ſhall roar out of Sihon; the heavens and earth ſhall ſhake, but the Lord will be the hope of his people.</hi> Though heaven and earth be ready to come together, yet a Believers hope abides.

               <p n="1">1. How a Chriſtian brings forth fruit. I anſwer; he brings forth fruit <hi>in the Vine;</hi> by nature we are barren; there is not one good bloſſome growing on us; but when by faith we are engraffed into Chriſt, then we grow and fructifie: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. <hi>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is that bleſſed Root which ſhoots up that ſap of grace into his Branches. The <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> tell us we have ſufficiency of our ſelves to bring forth good fruit: but how improper is this? doth not the Root contribute to the Branches? is it not of Chriſts pretious <hi>fulneſs</hi> that we receive? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16.

If the Saints bear any ſpiritual fruit, they are beholding to Chriſt for it, it is <hi>his</hi> wine, it is <hi>his</hi> myrrhe: <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 14.8. <hi>From me is thy fruit found.</hi>

                  <pb n="593" facs="tcp:168897:304"/>1.

               <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian brings forth <hi>outward</hi> fruit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fruit of good diſcourſe: <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.4. <hi>A wholeſome tongue is a tree of life.</hi> Gracious ſpeeches fall from the lips of a godly man, as fruit from a tree.</p>

<pb n="594" facs="tcp:168897:305"/>
kindly fruit; a good Chriſtian, but a bad Maſter; a good Chriſtian, but a bad Parent, doth not ſound well. That Miniſter can no more be good which wants zeal, than that wine is good which wants ſpirits; that Magiſtrate can no more be good which wants Juſtice, than that Pillar is good which is not upright.<note n="*" place="margin">Remota juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, quid ſunt Regna niſi magna latroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia? <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> That Child can no more be good who doth not honour his Parent, than a Traitor can be ſaid to be loyal. When <hi>Abſalom</hi> did riſe up in rebellion againſt his Father, the Mule which he rode upon (as if ſhe were weary of carrying ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) reſigns up her load to the great thick Oak, and there left him hanging by the head betwixt Heaven and Earth, as neither fit to aſcend the one, nor worthy to tread upon the other.</p>
               <p>Let Chriſtians be perſwaded to bring forth proper and genuine fruit, and ſhine forth in their Relations; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He who is not good in his Relations, goes under the juſt ſuſpition of an Hypocrite; let a man ſeem to be a penitent, or Zelot, yet if he bear not fruit proper to his ſtation, he is no <hi>tree of righteouſneſs,</hi> but ſome wild degenerate plant. There are ſome will pray, hear Sermons, diſcourſe well, this is good; but, <hi>what means the bleating of the ſheep?</hi> they are not good in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; this diſcovers they are foundered and unſound. A good Chriſtian labours to fill his Relations, and to go through all the parts of Religion, as the Sun through all the Signs of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> I like not thoſe Chriſtians who though they ſeem to be travelling to heaven, yet leave the duties of their Relations a as <hi>Terra incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> which they never come near.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The excellency of a Chriſtian is to bring forth proper fruit<note n="*" place="margin">Perfectum eſt quod propriam att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngit virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note>; wherein lies the goodneſs of a member in the body, but to diſcharge its proper office? The eye is to ſee, the ear to hear, &amp;c. So the excellency of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:168897:305"/>
is to bring forth that fruit which God hath aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; what is a thing good for which doth not do its proper work? what is a Clock good for that will not ſtrike? what is a ſhip good for that will not ſaile? what is a Roſe good for that doth not ſmell? what is that Profeſſor good for that doth not ſend forth a ſweet perfume in his Relation? the commendation of a thing is when it puts forth its proper vertue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to bring forth <hi>ſuitable fruit,</hi> ſpoils all the other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fruit which we bring forth. If a man were to make a Medicine, and ſhould leave out the chief ingredient, the Medicine would loſe its vertue. If one were to draw a Picture, and ſhould leave out an eye, it would ſpoile the Picture; there are many to whom Chriſt will ſay at the day of judgement, as to the young man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. <hi>Yet lackeſt thou one thing.</hi> Thou haſt pray'd, and faſted, and heard ſermons, <hi>yet lackeſt thou one thing,</hi> thou haſt not been good in thy Relations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Relative graces do much beautifie and ſet off a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſtian: It is the beauty of a Star to ſhine in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Orbe; Relative grace doth beſpangle a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A good Chriſtian brings forth <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> fruit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. he that bringeth forth fruit <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

There is a great deale of skill in the right timing of a thing; duties of Religion muſt be perform'd in the fit juncture of time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſtian duties that relate to our <hi>Neighbour</hi> muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be obſerved in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>reproving</hi> others muſt be ſeaſonable. Reproof is a duty; when we ſee others walk irregularly, like ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that march out of Rank and File, we ought <hi>mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="596" facs="tcp:168897:306"/>
yet <hi>gravely,</hi> to tell them of their ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. but let this fruit be brought forth <hi>in its ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Do it <hi>privately:</hi> Matth. 18.15. <hi>Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Do it when thou ſeeſt him <hi>in the beſt temper,</hi> not when his paſſions are up; that were pouring oyle on the flame; but when his ſpirit is meekned and calm'd; you put the ſeal on the wax when it is ſoft and plyable; there is a time when mens ſpirits are more flexible and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; now is the fitteſt ſeaſon to ſtamp a Reproof upon them, and it is likelyeſt to take impreſſion. When <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi> reproved <hi>Nabal,</hi> it was in the right ſeaſon; not when he was in wine, but when he was in his wits, and was fit to hear a Reproof, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſeaſon for Reproof is <hi>in the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Affliction tames mens ſpirits, and now a word of Reproof ſpoken prudentially may work with the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; a bitter potion is not refuſed if in caſe of extremity of pain. Affliction opens the ear to Diſcipline<note n="*" place="margin">Job 36.10.</note>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>comforting</hi> others muſt be ſeaſonable; <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.23. <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it?</hi> when we ſee one fallen into ſin, and with <hi>Peter</hi> weeping bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, oh now a word of comfort will do well.

                  </gap>ous <hi>Corinth</hi> being deeply humbled, the Apoſtle calls for oyle and wine to be poured into his wounds; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Ye ought rather to comfort him,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given, <hi>leſt perhaps ſuch an one ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of ſorrow.</hi> When the ſoul is wounded for ſin, now bring the mollifying oyntment of a promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. hang out free graces Colours, diſplay the glory of Gods Attributes, his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> to the ſinner, when the ſpirit is broken; a word of comfort ſpoken <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> is the putting it in joynt again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. this is to bring forth <hi>ſeaſonable fruit,</hi> when we give wine to them that
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:168897:306"/>
are of a heavy heart; <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Pleaſant words are as an honey-comb, ſweet to the ſoul. Jobs</hi> friends pretended to comfort him, but inſtead of pouring oyl into the wound, they poured in vinegar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Duties of Religion that relate to <hi>God,</hi> muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mourning</hi> for ſin is a duty; God loves a <hi>contrite heart,</hi> Pſal. 51.17. how powerful with God is the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rhetorique that a poor ſinner uſeth? but yet there is a time when mourning may not be ſo ſeaſonable; when God hath given us ſome eminent, ſignal deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and this mercy calls aloud to us to rejoyce, but we <hi>hang our Harps upon the willows,</hi> and ſit weeping; this ſadneſs is <hi>fructus intempeſtivus,</hi> fruit out of ſeaſon; there was a ſpecial time at the <hi>feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> when God called his people to rejoycing; <hi>Deutr.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Seven dayes ſhalt thou keep a ſolemn feaſt unto the Lord thy God, and thou ſhalt ſurely rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſat heavy and diſconſolate at that time when God called them to rejoycing, it had been very unſeaſonable, like mourning at a wedding; when we are called to thankſgiving, and we <hi>mingle our drink with tears;</hi> is not this to be highly unthankful for mercy? God would have his people humble, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. 'Tis the Divels policy either to keep us from duty, or elſe to put us upon it when it is leaſt in ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Rejoycing</hi> is a duty; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.1. But when God by ſome ſpecial providence calls us to weeping, now joy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable; this is that which God complains of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day did the Lord of Hoſts call to weeping, and behold joy and gladneſs, &amp;c.

                  <hi>If this iniquity be purged;</hi> it is a conciſe form of an Oath, as if God had ſaid, I ſwear it ſhall not by any prayer or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be expiated; the fruit of joy muſt be brought forth in its ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reading the VVord</hi> is a duty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. but this fruit muſt be brought forth <hi>in its ſeaſon.</hi> To read at home, when the Word is a preaching, or the Sacrament celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is unſeaſonable, nay ſinful; as <hi>Huſha</hi> ſaid, 2 Sam. 17.7. <hi>The Counſel is not good at this time:</hi> ſo I ſay of reading the VVord at home in time of publick admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, <hi>it is not good at this time;</hi> one duty is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for another, but not to juſtle out another; fruit muſt put forth ſeaſonably.

               <p>Let all <hi>the trees of righteouſneſs</hi> bring forh ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruit; in proſperity be thankful, in adverſity patient. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.1.

104.19. If the Moon ſhould ſhine at noon-day, or the Sun ſhine at midnight, this were not in ſeaſon; ſo it is in Spirituals.</p>
               <p>To excite to ſeaſonable fruit, conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſeaſonableneſs of a thing puts a value and pretiouſneſs upon it. There are certain meats which we eat of when they are <hi>in ſeaſon;</hi> if they be out of ſeaſon, we care not for them; we value a <hi>ſeaſonable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> elſe it is worth nothing. Duties of Religion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their ſeaſon are glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Creatures by the inſtinct of Nature obſerve their ſeaſon: <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Yea the Stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, &amp;c. Pliny</hi> ſaith they obſerve the ſeaſon of changing their climate; and ſhall not Chriſtians obſerve their ſeaſons, when to mourn, when to rejoyce? let not the <hi>Stork,</hi> and <hi>Turtle</hi> outwit them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Duties of Religion not well timed are dangerous; a ſtrong purgation may ſometimes be good; but to give it out of ſeaſon, when nature is ſpent, and between faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fits, it may kill the patient. Snow and Hail are good for the ground, when they come in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but when the Corn is ripe, now a ſtorm of Hail would do hurt, and be like a Flail to thraſh the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. It ſhows us who is a Chriſtian in Gods Kalendar,<label type="milestone">

Trees that ever God planted in his Vineyard. The <hi>Jaylor</hi> when God had changed him from a wild tree, to a <hi>tree of Righteouſneſs,</hi> brought forth ſweet and generous fruit.

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:168897:308"/>
are as <hi>the gleanings after Vintage.</hi> This is a <hi>lamentation</hi> and <hi>ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi> The ſilver ſhowers of the Sanctuary fall upon barren ground. Hiſtories relate that in ſome Countries they have no Trees at all growing. I will not be ſo uncharitable as to ſay we have no trees of Righteouſneſs in <hi>England;</hi> bleſſed be God we have ſome trees laden with Goſpel-fruit, <hi>Plants of renown;</hi> but few trees, in compariſon of the Thorns and Briars that grow; we have many will commend fruit, but few that bear fruit. To the unfruitful Chriſtian let me ſay four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unfruitfulneſs is a ſhame: Barrenneſs of old was counted a great ſhame. For a tree in winter to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, is no great wonder; but in the Spring and Summer to be without fruit, is a reproach to the Tree: So in the winter of ignorance and Popery to have leſs fruit was leſſe culpable; but in the Spring time of the Goſpel, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs hath ſhined ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in our Horizon, <hi>now</hi> to be without fruit is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not to be wiped away; men think it a ſhame to want an eye, or a limb; but it is a greater ſhame to want fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What account can the unfruitful Chriſtian give to God? God will come with this queſtion, Where is your fruit? a godly man dies full of fruit; <hi>Job</hi> 5.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of Corn, &amp;c.</hi> The unfruitful Chriſtian comes to his grave not as <hi>ſhock of corn,</hi> but as a <hi>bundle of ſtraw,</hi> fit only for the fire: 'Tis good to bethink our ſelves what anſwer we ſhall give to God for our barrenneſs. The Lord hath planted us in a rich ſoil; he may ſay to us as to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1. <hi>My beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hill, and he fenced it, and planted it with the choiſeſt Vine, &amp;c. and he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:168897:309"/>
and it brought forth wild grapes,</hi> in <hi>an Hill</hi>] hilly places are judged the fitteſt for Vines to grow in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10. there the Sun comes beſt, and is of more force for ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Grapes.</p>
               <p>In a <hi>fruitful</hi> hill] in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the horn of the ſon of oyle,</hi> or, <hi>the ſon of fatneſs,</hi> that is in a very fat, rich ſoil. So may God ſay to us, I have plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in an <hi>hilly place,</hi> you have been higher than the Nations round about you, you have been even lifed up to heaven with Ordinances; the Sunbeams of mercies, and <hi>Sihons</hi> ſilver drops have fallen upon you; but where is your fruit? your <hi>enjoyments</hi> are great, but what are your <hi>improvements?</hi> whom God finds without fruit, he leaves without excuſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that do not bring forth good fruit, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſte of the fruits that grow in heaven. Heaven is the Garden of God, the Paradiſe of pleaſure where the moſt rare delicious fruits grow; <hi>there</hi> are fruits that the Angels themſelves delight to feed on; it may be ſaid of thoſe Coeleſtial fruits, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Thy Plants are an Orchard of Pomgranates with pleaſant fruits, Camphire, and Spiknard, Saffron, Calamus, and Cinamon, with all trees of Frankincenſe, Myrrhe, and Aloes, with all the chief ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or as it is in the Original, <hi>the head of the ſpices.</hi> How Aromatical and fragrant are thoſe fruits which grow in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> now if you do not bring God <hi>your</hi> fruit, you ſhall never taſte <hi>his</hi> fruit: you that do not bring forth the <hi>fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhall never taſte the fruits of Paradiſe. Oh preſent Chriſt with your ſweet ſpices, give him your <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> Cant. 5.2. your <hi>ſpiced wine with the juice of the Pomgranate.</hi> Cant. 8.2. your <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> that is, repentance; this, though it be bitter to you, it is ſweet to Chriſt. Your <hi>ſpiced wine, and the juice of the Pomgranate;</hi> that is, love mixed with
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:168897:309"/>
obedience. Thoſe who have no Myrrhe, or wine to give God, ſhall never feed upon the <hi>Tree of life</hi> which bears ſeveral ſorts of fruit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Think of the heavy doom which will be paſſed upon the unfruitful perſon; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Non tantum de non ſervato, ſed de non aucto munere damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur impii. <hi>Proſper.</hi>
                  </note> This man had not embezeld his Talent, but becauſe he did not trade with it, and bring forth fruit, therefore he is ſentenced. God will condemn men as well for <hi>hiding</hi> their Talents, as for <hi>ſpending</hi> them; as well for not bearing Figs, as for bearing thorns; let unfruitful Chriſtians look to it; if God ſhould not cut down unprofitable branches, he ſhould be untrue in his Word; for he hath ſaid, <hi>Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down,</hi> Mat. 3.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It reproves ſuch as bring forth evil fruit. They <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch. </seg>2</label> are not trees of the <hi>Garden,</hi> but the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> their hearts are a fruitful ſoil for ſin, they bring forth pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Superſtition; ſome of their helliſh and bitter fruits are mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Adultery, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Seditions, Hereſies, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are <hi>wild grapes,</hi> Iſa. 5.2. <hi>Grapes of gall,</hi> Deut. 32.32. <hi>Fruit unto death,</hi> Rom. 7.5. theſe are Trees of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels planting; let not that man ſay his heart is good, who bears ſuch fruit.

Works of mercy are good, but when a man gives alms, not ſo much to feed the poor, as to feed his pride; now he brings forth fruit to himſelf, and this fruit is worm-eaten. God will ſay to all ſuch ſelf-ſeekers, as once he did to the people of the Jews, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. <hi>When ye faſted and mourned, did ye at all faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> Sinners did ye not bring forth fruit unto your ſelves?</p>

                  </note> we often plant Trees to be a ſhade to the houſe. God cares for no ſuch trees as are only for ſhade, he loves fruit. <hi>Arabia</hi> is called <hi>Faelix,</hi> becauſe of the ſweet fruits which grow there, <hi>Frankincenſe,</hi> with other perfumes and ſpices. That Chriſtian may be entitled <hi>Faelix, happy,</hi> that hath the ſweet fruits of the Spirit growing in his heart; be fruit-bearing trees. The Heathens had a cuſtom of <hi>dedicating</hi> their trees; they dedicated the Oak to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Lawrel to <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                  <pb n="605" facs="tcp:168897:310"/>
the Olive-tree to <hi>Minerva;</hi> but certainly, if we would dedicate a tree to the God of Heaven which he ſhould accept of, let it be a tree <hi>filled with the fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould be like the <hi>Pomcitron,</hi> which (as Naturaliſts ſay) bears fruit at all times of the year; when ſome of its fruit falls off, other fruit begins to mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and when that mellows, other of its fruit doth but begin to bloſſom, it is never without fruit. This is the Emblem of a good Chriſtian, he is never without fruit, either bloomimg in his affections, or fructifying in his converſation.</p>
               <p>That I may perſwade Chriſtians to fruitfulneſs, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to weigh theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Fruit is that which God expects from us, we are his plantation; and <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> 1 Cor. 9.7. Let us not be as <hi>Pharaohs kine,</hi> which devoured the fat, and yet ſtill were lean; let us not be ſtill devouring Sermons, yet never the fatter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fruitfulneſs is one of the beſt diſtinctive Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of a Chriſtian; <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The root of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous yieldeth fruit.</hi> Fruitfulneſs differeth a Saint from an Hypocrite; the Hypocrite is all for ſhow and pretence, he hath fair leaves, but <hi>the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit;</hi> fruit can no more be ſeparated from faith, than moiſture from the Air, it is the very definition of a branch in Chriſt, <hi>it bears fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.2. As a man differs from a beaſt by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> a beaſt differs from a plant by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> a plant differs from a ſtone by <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſo a good Chriſtian differs from an Hypocrite by <hi>fruit.</hi> Fruitfulneſſe puts a difference between the ſound tree and the hollow tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may not Hypocrites bring forth fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="606" facs="tcp:168897:311"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They do not bring forth fruit <hi>in the Vine;</hi> they bring forth in the ſtrength of <hi>parts,</hi> not in the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hypocrites bring forth ſomething like fruit, but it is not the right fruit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fruit they bear is not ſo ſweet. The <hi>Crab</hi> may bear fruit aſwell as the <hi>Pearmain,</hi> but this excells in ſweetneſs. The Hypocrite may pray, and give alms as well as a child of God, but there is difference in the fruit; the fruit of the Regenerate is mellow, it is ſweetned with Faith, it is ripened with love. The Hypocrites fruit is ſower and harſh, he doth not bring forth <hi>Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> but <hi>Crabs,</hi> not <hi>Figs,</hi> but <hi>wild Grapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſeeming fruit of Hypocrites dyes, and comes to nothing: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. <hi>He is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered.</hi> The Hypocrites fruit is like the <hi>graſs upon the houſe tops,</hi> which withereth before it groweth up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fruitfulneſs adorns a Chriſtian; the Fruit adorns the Tree; a Fruit-bearing Chriſtian is an Ornament to Religion; the more fruitful the branch is, the more fair to look on; <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.16. <hi>The Lord called thy name a green Olive-tree, fair, and of goodly fruit.</hi> A dead tree as it is <hi>unſerviceable,</hi> ſo it is <hi>uncomely.</hi> A Chriſtian deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, is beautiful and glorious. The fertil Chriſtian is compared to the <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> for pulchritude and fairneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrive to make themſelves look fair by their dreſſing and attyre, their chain of Pearl and Bracelets. O would you be fair in Gods eye? Then ſpread your Branches, ſend forth your Spices as Aromatick Trees in <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Fruitfulneſs is a good evidence to ſhow for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the fruits of <hi>love, humility, good works,</hi> are (as St.
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:168897:311"/>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) Seeds of hope, ſigns of Predeſtination, the happy preſages of future glory. <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom 4.11.</note> is alwayes accompanied with <hi>the fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> He that can ſhow good fruit, goes (like a ſhip laden with Jewels and Spices) full ſaile to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God delights in his fruitful trees; when his Garden flouriſheth he will walk there; he who curſeth the <hi>barren tree,</hi> will taſte of the fruitful tree; <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I am come into my Garden my ſiſter, my Spouſe, I have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Myrrhe with my Spice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It Exhorts them that do bear fruit, that they would <label type="milestone">

Chriſtians ſhould be like that ground in the Parable which brought forth <hi>ſome ſixty, ſome an hundred fold,</hi> Matth. 13.8. He who hath a little gold, labours to encreaſe it; and is not grace more precious than gold? ſome Chriſtians have a little fruit, and they think that is well; like Trees that have an Apple or two growing on them to ſhow that they are of the right kind: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Two or three berries in the top of the uppermoſt bough.</hi> They are like the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> which had <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>yet more and more,</hi> Phil. 1.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="908" facs="tcp:168897:312"/>Now that I may preſs Chriſtians who have Fruit, to bring forth more fruits of patience, humility, love, &amp;c. Conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is the end why we have new coſt laid out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us that we ſhould bring forth more fruit. The Lord is ſtill Manuring us; not a week; not a day, but he is at new coſt with us, he rains down golden ſhowers; and why is God at all this charges with us, but that we may bring forth more Fruit?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more fruit we bring forth, the more glory we bring to God; <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that ye bear much fruit.</hi> Though it is a bleſſed ſight to ſee any Fruit, I would not diſcourage ſuch as bear but two or three Olive berries, it is a ſigne they are not dead trees; it is obſervable, the ground in the Parable which brought forth more ſparingly, Chriſt calls it <hi>good ground,</hi> Matth. 13.8. If the Husbandman ſees a thin ear, which hath but a little Corn in it, yet he is glad to ſee ſome, and he carries it into the Barn. So though thou art a <hi>thin ear,</hi> thou haſt not ſo much grace as others, God will not reject thee; if there be any Fruit, God will accept it; he that gained but two Talents, had his <hi>Euge bone ſerve;</hi> Matth. 25.22. <hi>Well done thou good and faithful ſervant.</hi> This I ſpeak that I may not diſcourage the weak Chriſtian; though thou haſt leſſe Fruit growing on thee, thou art too good a tree to be made fewel on, thou ſhalt be tranſplanted into Paradiſe. But I ſay, you ſhould not reſt in ſmall beginnings, but labour to put more Oyle in the Lamp, and be encreaſing your ſtock of grace; for, the more Fruit you bring forth, the more glory God hath; <hi>herein is my Father glorified;</hi> though the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace may bring <hi>ſalvation</hi> to you, yet it doth not bring ſo much <hi>glory</hi> to God.

Text, when the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>Filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs,</hi> he adds, <hi>which are unto the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> It is a praiſe to the Husbandman, and commends his skill and induſtry when the plants in his Orchard thrive; ſo when the plants of Righteouſneſs flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, this is to the praiſe of Gods glory; it is the higheſt end of the Creature to bring glory to God; better loſe our lives, than loſe the end of our living.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The fuller we are of Fruit, the more we are like Chriſt, who was <hi>full of grace and truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14. he received Spirit <hi>without meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34.

If Chriſt builds a neſt of comfort, it is in thoſe Trees which fructifie moſt; though the Lord Jeſus doth accept of the truth of grace, yet he commends only the degrees of grace: <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael;</hi> he ſets a trophy of renown upon that Faith; Chriſt will <hi>pardon</hi> a weak Faith, he will <hi>honour</hi> a great Faith. It was not a ſparckle of love Chriſt commended in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> but love flaming; <hi>Luke</hi> 7.74. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="7">7.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> means to fruitfulneſs.<note place="margin">Direction.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſenſible of unfruitfulneſs. Many might have been fruitful in grace, if they had not conceited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo; he that thinks himſelf fruitful enough, is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren enough; be ſenſible of your wants; 'tis better to complain than preſume.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you would be fruitful, remove thoſe things which will hinder fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:168897:314"/>1. Cheriſhing any ſecret luſt in the heart; ſin lived in, is like Vermin to the tree, which deſtroyes the fruit; grace cannot thrive in a ſinful heart: In ſome ſoil plants will not grow; the cheriſhing of ſin is the withering of the Fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of riches: <hi>The cares of the world choaked the ſeed,</hi> Matth. 13. The love of ſin poiſons the Fruit, the love of riches choaks it. This is like a blaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trees, it deſtroyes the pretious Fruits of godlineſs: <hi>Love not the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third means to fruitfulneſs, is weeping for ſin. Moiſture helps germination in trees; holy tears do wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the trees of God and make them more fruitful: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magnalen</hi> (a weeping plant) how fruitful was ſhe in love to Chriſt? moiſt grounds, as your <hi>Marſhes,</hi> are more fertile: the ſoul that is moiſtened and ſteeped in tears, is moſt frugiferous: never did <hi>Davids</hi> graces flouriſh more, than when he watered his Couch with tears. When the Plant hath been pricked whereby it lets forth gumm, or tears, it is fuller of Fruit, and the Fruit is ſweeter. That Chriſtian who hath been pricked at heart for ſin, whereby he lets forth plenty of tears, beareth the ſweeteſt Fruits of grace: Moiſture helps fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would be fruitful, often apply the blood of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſt, and the Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Apply the blood of Chriſt. Naturaliſts ſay, that blood applyed to the Root of ſome trees makes them bear bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sure I am, the blood of Chriſt applyed to the heart, makes it flouriſh more in holineſs. None ſo fruitful as a Believer; I know (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) whom I have believed, 2 Tim. 1.12. there was the applying blood to the Root of the tree, and how fruitful was he in zeal, love to Chriſt, Heroical courage! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:168897:314"/>
Chriſt dyed for him, never thinks he can do, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer enough for Chriſt. When we read, and pray, now we do but water the Branches; when we believe, now we water the Root of the Tree and make it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Apply the Promiſes. Husbandmen have an art to comfort the ſpirits of the Root to make the tree bear better: Apply the Promiſes; theſe are for comforting the ſpirits of a Chriſtian, and then he puts forth fruit more vigorouſly. It is an experiment in nature, the Root of the Pine tree watered with wine, doth cauſe it to flouriſh, the Promiſes are as wine to water the <hi>Trees of Righteouſneſs</hi> whereby they ſpread and augment more in grace. Ever preſerve <hi>the ſpirits</hi> of the tree if you would have it bear; a penſive dejected ſoul is leſs fruitful; but when through the Promiſes a Chriſtians heart is cheared and comforted, now he is enriched with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits, <hi>Camphire,</hi> and <hi>Spiknard,</hi> and <hi>Frankincenſe;</hi> he is like a Tree laden with fruit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another means to fruitfulneſs, is humility. The low grounds are moſt fruitful: <hi>The Valleys are covered with Corn,</hi> Pſal. 65.13. The humble heart is the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart. It is obſerved in ſome Countreys, as in <hi>France,</hi> that the beſt and largeſt Grapes which they make their wine of, grow upon the lower ſort of Vines. The largeſt and faireſt Fruits of the Spirit grow in a lowly Chriſtian: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>God gives grace to the humble.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf <hi>the leaſt of Saints,</hi> yet he was the chief of the Apoſtles. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was low in her own eyes, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.48. but this lowly Plant did bear that bleſſed <hi>Vine</hi> which brought the Fruit of ſalvation to the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you would be fruitful in grace, be much in good conference: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:168897:315"/>
ſpake often one to another.</hi> There is an obſervation ſome have concerning the <hi>Sympathy of Plants;</hi> ſome plants will bear better near other trees, than when they grow alone, as is ſeen in the <hi>Myrtle</hi> and <hi>Olive:</hi> This holds true in Divinity; the trees of righteouſneſs when they aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and grow near together, thrive beſt in godlineſſe. The communion of Saints is an excellent means for fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Chriſtians encreaſe one anothers knowledge, ſtrengthen one anothers Faith, clear one anothers eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. When the Trees planted in Gods Orchard ſtand at a diſtance, and grow ſtrange one to another, they are leſs fruitful.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you would be fruit-bearing trees, be near the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sanctuary:</hi> Jer. 17.8. <hi>He ſhall be like a tree planted by the waters, and that ſpreadeth out the roots by the River; her leaf ſhall be green, nor ſhall it ceaſe from yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit.</hi> The Word preached will not only make us <hi>knowing</hi> Chriſtians, but <hi>growing</hi> Chriſtians. Miniſters are compared to <hi>Clouds,</hi> Iſa. 5.6. their Doctrine drops as the rain, and makes the trees of God fruitful. Thoſe that ſit under theſe ſilver drops (the wind of the Spirit blowing) are like that <hi>flock of ſheep,</hi> Cant. 2.4. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every one bears twins, and none is barren among them.</hi> I wonder not that they are barren trees and <hi>nigh unto cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> that are not under the droppings of the Sanctuary; a Chriſtian can no more be fruitful without Ordinances, than a tree without ſhowres.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, if you would fructifie apace, go to God and deſire him to make you fruitful; God is call'd <hi>the Husband man,</hi> John. 15.1. and he hath an art above all other Husbandmen; they can plant and prune trees, but if they be dead they cannot make them bear. God can make the barren tree bear, he can put life into a dead tree: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. It is not <hi>Pauls planting,</hi> but the <hi>Spirits watering</hi> muſt give the encreaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="615" facs="tcp:168897:315"/>Pray to God to make you fruitful though it be by <hi>affliction;</hi> oftentimes God makes us grow in grace this way; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.11. <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs afterward it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs.</hi> The bleeding Vine bears beſt; It is an obſervation, that the pulling off ſome of the bloſſoms of a tree, makes the fruit fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the reaſon is, becauſe the ſap hath the leſs to nouriſh; ſome Writers ſay, they have known a tree by having too many bloſſoms, hath bloſſomed it ſelf dead. The notion holds true in a Scriptural ſence; God by pulling off ſome of the bloſſoms of our outward comforts makes us bring forth fairer fruit; ſome have ſo bloſſom'd in proſperity, that they have bloſſom'd themſelves into hell: It is an ancient experiment, that the planting of ſome tender trees near the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſun doth them hurt, and parcheth the Fruit, the Sun being ſo extream hot: Too much proſperity, like the <hi>Weſt ſun</hi> doth Chriſtians much hurt, and parcheth all good affection, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. Oh pray to God that he would make you fruitful though it be by bleeding.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ordine cauſalitatis,</hi> in reſpect of cauſality; faith is the cauſe of charity; therefore more noble; for as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Quicquid pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritudinis in arbore ex radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce proficiſcitur.</note> though the root of the tree be not ſeen, yet all the beauty of the branches procee'ds from the Root: So all the beauty that ſparckles in <hi>love</hi> proceeds from the Root of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith is more excellent than charity <hi>Ratione bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficij;</hi> Faith is a more beneficial grace to us; for by faith we are ingraffed into Chriſt, and partake of the fatneſs of the Olive.

               <p n="3">3. The third Argument preſſing Chriſtians to love, is, this is <hi>Decus &amp; ornamentum Evangelij,</hi> it ſets a crown of honour upon Religion, it renders the Goſpel lovely in the eyes of the world; it was an honour to Religion in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, when the Heathens could ſay, <hi>Ecce quam mutuo diligunt,</hi> ſee how the Chriſtians love one another! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold how good, and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi> it is like the pretious oyntment upon the head, that runs down to the skirts of Religions Garments. O what a bleſſed ſight it is to ſee Chriſtians link'd together with the ſilver link of charity! the Church is Chriſts Temple, the Saints are <hi>living ſtones,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. how beautiful is this Temple, when the ſtones of it are cemented together with love! it was ſaid of the firſt Temple there was no noiſe of hammer in it; and oh that there might be no noiſe of ſtrife and diviſion in Gods Church; could we ſee <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>verity</hi> like the Vine and Elm mutually embracing; could we ſee the children of <hi>Sion</hi> ſpreading themſelves as Olive plants round about their Mothers table in an amicable and peaceable manner, how ſhould this adorn Religion, and be as a lure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and draw others to be in love with it; what is <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> but <hi>Religation?</hi> a binding and knitting together of hearts! we are knit to God by Faith, and one to another by love.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Argument is the neceſſity of love; love is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>debt;</hi> now debts muſt be paid; <hi>Owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to any man but love, Rom.</hi> 13.8. The debt of love dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from other debts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="624" facs="tcp:168897:320"/>1. When a debt is paid, we receive an Acquittance, and are to pay it no more; but this debt of love muſt be alwayes paying; in heaven we muſt be paying this debt, <hi>love to God,</hi> and the <hi>Saints;</hi> there is no diſcharge from this debt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other debts may be diſpenſed with; we forgive a debt ſometimes, as that <hi>Creditor</hi> did in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.27. <hi>The Lord of that ſervant was moved with compaſſion and forgave him the debt.</hi> But this debt of love is by no means to be diſpenſed with, it muſt be paid; if we do not pay this debt, God will come upon us with an arreſt and throw us into hell priſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In civil debts between man and man, the more they pay, the leſs they have; but in this debt of love it is quite contrary; the more we pay, the more we have; the more grace from God, the more love from others; love like the <hi>widdows oyle</hi> encreaſeth by pouring out; by paying other debts we grow poor, by paying this debt we grow richer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Love makes us like God, <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. a golden ſentence? <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, the Apoſtle doth more commend love in this one word, <hi>God is love,</hi> than Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth in his whole Chapter; as the nature of the Sun is <hi>light,</hi> ſo Gods nature is <hi>love:</hi> The three perſons in the Trinity are all love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God the Father is love; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world;</hi> that God ſhould part with Chriſt out of his boſome, <hi>the Son of his love,</hi> and lay this jewel as it were to pawn for our ſalvation, oh unparalleld love! never was ſuch love ſhowed to the Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God the Son is love; how did Chriſt love his Spouſe when he died for her! his ſides drop'd blood, his heart drop'd love; ſuch a vein of love was opened in him that our ſins could not ſtench; love was the wing on
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:168897:320"/>
which Chriſt did fly into the Virgins womb. <hi>Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> hre was love covered over with fleſh; and <hi>Chriſt on the Croſs,</hi> here was a book of love laid open before us to read in. <hi>Per vulnera viſcera</hi> —</p>
               <p n="3">3. God the Holy Ghoſt is love, his appearing <hi>in the likeneſs of a Dove</hi> ſhow'd his nature; the Dove ſaith <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> is an amicable creature, it is without gall; what are all the motions of the Spirit but tenders of love? what is the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the Spirit but the print of love? why doth this bleſſed Spirit as a ſuitor come a woing to ſinners, but that they may know <hi>he is in love?</hi> thus all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity are <hi>love;</hi> and the more we ſhine in the grace of Love, the more we reſemble the God of Love.</p>

                  <hi>a form of knowledg. Rom.</hi> 2.20. Knowledg alone is but a dead form, having nothing to animate it: he that hath knowledg only, is a ſpiritual <hi>ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born:</hi> he looks like a Chriſtian, but hath neither appetite nor motion. Knowledg alone makes men monſters in religion; they are all <hi>head,</hi> but no <hi>feet,</hi> they do not <hi>walk in Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.6. A man may have knowledg and be neglective of his duty, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> they knew what was juſt, but did it not: A man may have knowledg, and be prophane; he may have a clear head, and a foul heart.

               <p n="2">2. Knowledg alone will not ſave, therefore it will not make a man happy: if knowledg alone will ſave, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all that have knowledg ſhall be ſaved; but that is not

               <p>How unprofitable is the luxuriancy of knowledge? he who is only fill'd with knowledge, is like a glaſſe fill'd with froth; what a vain, fooliſh thing is it to have knowledge, and make no ſpiritual uſe of it!

So many a man carries a great deal of knowledge about him, but doth not feed upon the ſweetneſs of it, nor digeſt his knowledge into practice. To know only to know, is like one that knows certain Countries by the Map, and can diſcourſe of them, but never travell'd into them, nor taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſweet ſpices of thoſe Countries. So the Gnoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick in Religion hath heard and read much of the beauty of holineſs, but never travelled into Religion, nor taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>how good the Lord is;</hi> what is it the better to have the Bible in our heads, if not in our hearts? can <hi>Notions</hi> be <hi>Cordials</hi> when we come to dye?

knowledge: you do not call him an Handicraftſman who doth not work in his Trade; let a man be never ſo skilfull, yet you do not call him a Goldſmith who did never refine a veſſel, or try gold; though a man hath skill in Chirurgery, yet you do not call him a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian who did never lance a wound, or dreſs a ſore: ſo it is improper to call him a Chriſtian who hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but no practice; he knows he ſhould mortifie ſin, but he doth not, he knows he ſhould ſhow works of mercy, but he doth not; he never yet wrought in the trade of godlineſs.</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Word of God is not only a Rule of knowledge, but a Rule of duty. If you ſpeak to your Children and tell them what is your mind, it is not only that they may know your mind, but do it. God gives us his Word not only as a Picture to look upon, but as a Copy to write after. The Maſter gives his ſervant a

Candle, not to gaze on, but to work by: The light of Scripture is to guide our feet into the way of obedience; and ſo <hi>David</hi> calls the Word of God, not a Lamp to his eyes, but a <hi>Lanthorn to his feet,</hi> Pſal. 119. implying, that the light of the Word is rather to walk by than to ſee by. God gives us his Word as his Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he leaves in charge with us to ſee it perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If God would only have had his Laws to be known or talk'd of, he might have delivered them to Parrots: If he would only have had them kept ſafe, he might have <hi>graven them with an iron pen, and laid in the rock for ever,</hi> Job 19.24. But therefore he delivers the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of heaven <hi>to men,</hi> that they ſhould be obeyed. The Lord gives us his Precepts as a Phyſitian gives the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent his <hi>Receits</hi> to take and apply: for this end are all Gods inſtitutes that we may by practice apply them for the purging out ſin, and bringing the ſoul into a more healthful temper: God gives us his Word, as the Mother gives the Child the breaſt, not only to look upon, but to draw it; many have gone to hell with the breaſt in their mouthes, becauſe they have not drawn it, and turned the milk of the Word into ſacred nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Search from one end of the Bible to the other, and you ſhall find the Crown ſtill ſet upon the head of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Saints renowned of old have ever received their commendations and titles of honour from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <hi>Moſes a man mighty in words and deeds,</hi> Acts. 7.22. <hi>Cornelius a man fearing God, giving much alms.</hi> When Chriſt pronounceth the ſentence of abſolution, ſee how it runs, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom; for I was an hungred and ye gave me meat; thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> Matth. 25.34, 35. Chriſt is not ſaid at the laſt day to reward men according to their <hi>knowledge,</hi> but their <hi>deeds: Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me to give every man according as his works ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22.12.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Men know they ſhould be winged with activity in the duties of religion, but they can be content to let theſe duties alone. They know they ſhould mortify the fleſh, pray in their families, be juſt in their dealing, give alms to the poor; but if there were no other Bible to teach us theſe things than the lives of moſt, we ſhould not know there were any ſuch duties Commanded. For the moſt part, men are no changlings; what they were twenty, thirty years ago, they are the ſame ſtill; as proud and unreformed as ever. The beſt Tooles have
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:168897:329"/>
been either broke, or worn out upon their rockie hearts, yet they are as unhewn and unpoliſhed as ever. <hi>The Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are burnt,</hi> the lungs of Gods Miniſters are waſted, yet how much <hi>reprobate ſilver</hi> remaines ſtill in many of our Congregations! If none are happy but doers of the word, how few will be ſaved?</p>
               <p>But why do ſo few come up to the Practical part of religion? Surely it is 1. for want of deep humiliation: he that hath <hi>the ſpirit of bondage</hi> let looſe upon him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends himſelf as it were in the Forlorne-hope, he ſees the ſea of his ſins before him ready to ſwallow him up, and the juſtice of God behind purſuing and ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him; he cries out as St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> Wilt thou have me repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? I ſtand ready preſt to what ever ſervice thou Commandeſt: the humbled ſinner doth not <hi>diſpute,</hi> but <hi>obey.</hi> The ſeed that had not <hi>depth of earth,</hi> withered and came to nothing, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.5, 6. The reaſon men do not bring forth the fruits of obedience, is, becauſe they have not <hi>depth of earth:</hi> they were never yet deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſin: A proud man will never obey; inſtead of trampling his ſins under his feet, he tramples Gods Laws under his feet. <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.3, 4. He who ſtoops in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is the likelieſt to put his neck under Chriſts yoak: he that ſees himſelf within an inch of hell, asks the Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved? Act.</hi> 16.30. What will not a condemned man do for a pardon?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Want of Practice, is for want of faith. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> This makes Sermons to be like ſhowres of raine falling upon a rock, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mollifie, nor fructifie, becauſe men are in part infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; they had rather <hi>diſpute</hi> then <hi>believe:</hi> ſuch as live <hi>Scepticks</hi> die <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> Did men believe ſin were ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that wrath and hell followed it, would they take this
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:168897:329"/>
ſerpent into their boſom? Did they believe there were a beautie in holineſs; did they believe <hi>godlineſs</hi> were <hi>gain;</hi> that there were joy in the way, and heaven at the end, would they not turn their feet into the way? Men have ſome ſlight tranſient thoughts of theſe things, but their judgments are not fully convinced, nor their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience fully captivated into the belief of them. This, this is Satans maſter-piece, his draw-net by which he drags millions to hell by keeping them in infidelitie; he knows if he can but keep them from the belief of the truth, he is ſure to keep them from the practice of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mens backwardneſs to Practice, is from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the practical part of religion; it is eaſie to hear a truth, to give ſome aſſent, to commend it, to make a profeſſion of it; but to digeſt a truth into practice, this is hard, and men are overgrown with ſloth, they are loth to put themſelves to too much trouble; <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.15. Can men dig for gold, and not for <hi>the Pearl of price?</hi> Can they take pains in the purſuing of their ſins, and will they be at no paines for the ſaving of their ſouls? I dare be bold to ſay, It coſts many a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more ſweat and labour in toyling about his luſts, then it coſts a Saint in ſerving his God<note n="*" place="margin">Impij quare ſtrenuè ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt diabole! <hi>Cypr.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The World comes between and hinders: <hi>The thorns choak the ſeed of the Word.</hi> Men practice ſo much in the world, that they have no time to practice better things: the world is like a Mill, it makes ſuch a noiſe in carnal hearts, that it drowns the ſound of Gods ſilver Trumpet. Mens affections are ſomtimes kindled by the preaching of the word, and we begin to hope that the flame of godlineſs will break forth in their lives, but then comes the earth and puts out this fire; how many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons lie buried in earthly hearts? More die then are put in the Bill of Mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:168897:330"/>Oh that the want of Practice in this age were more laid to heart! <hi>This is a Lamentation, and ſhall be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:</hi> many Profeſſors are <hi>all ear;</hi> if we ſhould ſee a Creature made up of nothing but <hi>ear,</hi> it were a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in nature; how many ſuch monſters are there in Chriſtianitie? They hear, and hear, and are never the better; like the <hi>Salamander</hi> which lies in the fire, but as Naturaliſts ſay, it is never the hotter.</p>
               <p>Some ſatisfie themſelves with the having of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Then ſaid Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, ſeeing I have a Levite to my Prieſt.</hi> But what is Phyſick if it be not applied? what is it to have the <hi>ſound</hi> of the word in our ears, unleſs we have the <hi>ſavour</hi> of it in our hearts? It will be little comfort to men on their death-beds, to think that Chriſt hath been preached in their ſtreets, and they have been lifted up to heaven in Goſpel adminiſtrations, when their Conſciences ſhall tell them they have been unholy and unreformed; they have come into Gods Houſe as the beaſts did into the <hi>Ark;</hi> they came in unclean, and went out of the <hi>Ark</hi> unclean.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Goſpel-obedience is an evidence of ſincerity; as our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Saviour Chriſt ſaid in another ſence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.25. <hi>The works which I do, bear witneſs of me.</hi> Though never man ſpake like Chriſt, yet when he comes to put himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a trial, he will not be judged by his words, but by his works, <hi>they</hi> bear witneſs of me; ſo it is not a Chriſtians golden words, but his works which teſtifie of him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I have turned my feet unto thy ſtatutes. David</hi> did not only turn his <hi>ears</hi> to Gods Teſtimonies, but he turned his <hi>feet</hi> to them, he walked in them: we judge not of the health of a mans body by his high colour, but by the pulſe of the arm where the blood chiefly operates: ſo we judge not of a Chriſtians ſoundneſs by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or high expreſſions; what is this high colour? <hi>Saul</hi> may be among the Prophets; but the eſtimate of a Chriſtian is to be taken by his obediential actings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be practitioners in Religion will not only do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> your ſelves good but others: This will both honour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and propagate it.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. In life; is it not a comfort to a man when he hath been caſting up his Accounts and finds that he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Trade? you come hither in the uſe of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Word, and Prayer, to trade for heaven; now if ye find upon a true account that ye have gain'd in the Trade of godlineſs, and are <hi>fill'd with the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> will not this be a great comfort to you? he who is full of good works, God will gather the fruit, and bleſſe the Tree.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Oh with what comfort may a Chriſtian lay his life down, when he hath laid his life out in the ſervice of God! This was a death-bed Cordial to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. <hi>Remember, O Lord, I beſeech thee how I have walked before thee in truth.</hi> A man may repent of his fruitleſs knowledge, but never did any man repent of his obedience when he came to die; never did any Chriſtian who is going to reſt with God, repent that he had walked with God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What is the end of all Gods adminiſtrations but obedience? what are all Gods Promiſes but perſwaſions to obedience? what is the end of all Gods threatnings which ſtand as the <hi>Angel</hi> with a flaming ſword in their hand, but to drive us to obedience! <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.28. <hi>A curſe if ye will not obey.</hi> What is the voice of mercy

but to call us to duty? the Father gives his child money to bribe him to ingenuity. The fire under the Still makes the Roſes drop; the fire of Gods mercies is to make the ſweet water of obedience diſtill from us; mercy (as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith) is a medicine which God applies to us to cure our barrenneſs: what are all the examples of Gods juſtice upon non-proficients, but allarums to awaken us out of the bed of ſloth, and put us into a poſture of ſervice? Gods rod upon others is a Feſcue to point us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if God hath not his end in reſpect of duty, we cannot have our end in reſpect of glory.</p>

There are none that diſobey God but Man and the Divel, and can we finde none to joyne with but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Diſobedience is a ſin againſt Self-preſervation<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.17.</note>.

               <p n="3">3. A child of God deſires to keep every command;
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:168897:334"/>

               <p>Unſound hearts as they are <hi>ſlight</hi> in their obedience, ſo they are <hi>partial;</hi> ſome duty they will diſpenſe with, ſome ſinne they will indulge, <hi>in this thing the Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy ſervant,</hi> 1 King. 5.18. The Hypocrite will walk in ſome of Gods ſtatutes, not in all, like a foundred Jade that will not ſet all his feet upon the ground, but favours one foot: Such foundered Chriſtians there are, who halt, and limp, and favour themſelves in ſome things, though it be to the hazard of their ſouls; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> could as well die as leave his Inceſt.

               <p>But why muſt this ſilver thread of faith run through the whole work of obedience?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, becauſe faith looks at Chriſt in every duty, and ſo both the <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>offering</hi> is accepted: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath accepted us in the beloved.</hi> We are not accepted through <hi>our duties,</hi> but through <hi>the beloved:</hi> Faith looks at the Merit of Chriſt to take away the guilt; and the Spirit of Chriſt to take away the filth which cleaves to the moſt angelical ſervices, thus it procures acceptance.</p>
               <p>The High Prieſt under the Law looked at Chriſt in all; when he offered up the Sacrifice, he laid his hand upon the head of the beaſt ſlain, which did point at the Meſſiah, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.10. So Faith laies its hand in every Goſpel-ſacrifice upon the head of Chriſt; his Blood doth cleanſe, and the ſweet Odours of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion do perfume our holy things. Now Faith looking up to Chriſt in every Duty, finds accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Nay, Faith doth not only look at Chriſt, but it unites to Chriſt, as the Siens is graffed into the ſtock. Believers are part of Chriſt; Chriſt and the Saints make one body Myſtical; no wonder then if God caſts a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſpect upon thoſe ſervices which Believers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to him.</p>
